You know deep down that the HoloLens isn’t going to be what they say it is, because it never is with Microsoft. For a great example of this, read Ben Kuchera’s “Skeptical of HoloLens? It’s time to rewatch how Microsoft sold us on the Kinect”. So we’re not really disappointed, because we know what to expect. But for some reason, the HoloLens announcement has really been upsetting me over the last 12 hours or so. Why is MS selling people promises that they know they won’t deliver? Or at least can’t deliver for another five years? Why are you getting people excited? It’s a wonderful future you’ve got painted here, but we’ve seen this show before. You need to stop this behavior Microsoft, because isn’t helping, and I know it sounds odd coming from me, but I really do want your products to kick ass. So when we watch the Microsoft keynote, we don’t get excited because we know what to expect. We’ve learned from past behavior not to competely believe what Microsoft is selling. And this is why so many people love what Apple delivers. When Apple gives demos of their new product, they aren’t throwing in CG showing how they hope things will happen some day in the future. Instead they show the real deal. How it’s being used yesterday. And it’s those possibilities that get us excited. And Apple frames it so well. The product demos never show us at work (because who wants to get excited about work?), instead the demos show us how the product will be used in our life. How it can make the things we enjoy even better. And that is probably the biggest difference between Apple and Microsoft. Apple knows when it’s time to show a new product. Apple knows when something is ready for real world use, and Apple won’t rush something out the door because of market pressures. Something competitors need to learn to get consumers excited when they announce new products." />
