As security expert Cem Paya put it, that was a conscious decision Google made when it created Android.

The tradeoff was giving carriers and manufacturers control over their Android releases, leaving Google unable to centrally push out operating system updates. Some carriers and manufacturers are better than others, it’s true, but they all pretty much suck when it comes to pushing updates. There really isn’t a better way to put it.
