<p>Roger Parloff on the hearing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Judges Jacobs and Lohier seemed quite concerned that Judge Cote had used the wrong standard, but Jacobs’s qualms clearly went much further—seeming to question the government’s judgment in ever having brought the case. His problem was that Apple was a new entrant that was bringing competition to a market that had been, until then, dominated by a “monopolist,” Amazon. Judge Jacobs also repeatedly referred to Amazon’s $9.99 pricing policy, whereby it sold books at below the wholesale acquisition cost, as “predatory pricing,” and seemed to suggest that Amazon was obviously using it as a means of maintaining its monopoly dominance.”</p>

<p>In fact, the judges seem to think the wrong company prosecuted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At times Judge Jacobs came close to suggesting that the government had prosecuted the wrong company. At the very least, he said, a horizontal initiative “used to break the hold of a monopolist” ought not be found to be illegal per se.

<p>Perhaps the DOJ should consider a case against a company that its power to <a href="http://bakingpixel.com/2014/09/amazon-ebook-tactics/">influence</a> the <a href="http://bakingpixel.com/2014/08/amazon-george-orwell/">ebook industry</a>.</p>
