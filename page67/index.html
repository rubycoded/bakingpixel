				<p>The Verge reports that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/3/5169878/ups-is-researching-its-own-delivery-drones-to-compete-with-amazons">UPS is testing and evaluating using drones to delivery parcels</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UPS has a number of different ways it might utilize drones. It could offer something similar to Amazon’s Prime Air, or it might use them to help move packages around its own warehouses. Calo was skeptical of the video offered up by Amazon, where a drone drops off a package in a family’s suburban driveway. “I think from both a tech and a policy perspective, delivering to consumers in residential areas is going to be tough thing to accomplish any time soon,” says Calo. “But a company like UPS could use drones to bring packages quickly and cheaply from a major airport or city to pick-up centers in more remote locations, speeding up delivery for a lot of customers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should we expect FedEx and DHL to jump on the bandwagon soon?</p>

<p>Legalisation would merely be a formality since businesses in China are already allowed to use drones as long as they apply for approval to do so.</p>

<p>Finally. VSCO Cam is my favourite app for editing my iPhone photos. Android photographers will be delighted to finally be able to add this awesome app to their arsenal.</p>

<p>Users will also be able to access VSCO Grid, an online gallery for users to showcase their works.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of using your standard password, all of your info — be it passwords, photos, credit card numbers, passport data or that note reminding you where you hid the kids Christmas presents — is locked inside of a vault that can only be opened using biometric face recognition and a selfie… although we suggest you keep a straight face since duck lips might throw the system off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if someone tries to bypass the system using a picture of you?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To keep things even safer, individual ‘drawers’ in the vault can be locked with additional security measures; and the app can be set to prompt the user to blink so that someone with a picture of you can’t access the app by holding up your mug shot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It had been more than two months since a popular University of Michigan medical student was shot to death, and police seemingly had few leads.</p>

  <p>But on Oct. 3 — 45 miles from where student Paul DeWolf was killed in his Ann Arbor fraternity — a man in Detroit attempted to log onto a computer he’d just purchased through Craigslist. The man didn’t know it, but the Mac laptop had been stolen from DeWolf’s next-door neighbor around the time he was killed.</p>

  <p>That computer had an app that would lead police directly to it, and to the two suspects now charged in DeWolf’s killing.</p>

				<p>Jathan Sadowski writes on WIRED.com about <a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/12/stop-thinking-that-coding-is-the-answer-to-all-of-societys-problems/">how pushing people to code will widen the divide between the rich and poor</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, the burden of adding coding to curricula ignores the fact that the English literacy rate in America is still abysmal: 45 million U.S. adults are “functionally illiterate” and “read below a 5th grade level,” according to data gathered by the Literacy Project Foundation. Almost half of all Americans read “so poorly that they are unable to perform simple tasks such as reading prescription drug labels.” The reading proficiency of Americans is much lower than most other developed countries, and it’s declining.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t agree with Sadowski about how literacy and the ability to code should be lumped together when considering the school curriculum. Just because a person is illiterate doesn’t mean that they are precluded from learning programming.</p>

<p>Teaching children how to code will instil in them problem-solving skills and logical thinking. More importantly, it will eventually become essential for our children to be able to read and write code. <a href="http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/software-is-changing-the-world-again/">Software is changing the world.</a> Technology has become an integral part of our lives. We need to be able to understand how technology works.</p>

				<p>We brought your attention to LINE recently, notably when the popular Asian messaging system hit the <a href="http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/lines-300-million-users-will-be-a-problem-for-whatsapp/">300 million user milestone</a>. The company isn’t intent on resting on its laurels, and has just launched LINE Shopping in Malaysia today. The launch of LINE Shopping in Indonesia at the end of November was quite successful, collecting about 900,000 subscribers within a week. You can bet that Naver (the company behind LINE) is looking to repeat that feat or improve upon it.</p>

<p>LINE is already well known for its adorable and expressive stickers, and offering a free sticker set as an incentive to get folks to subscribe will definitely drive subscription numbers.</p>

<p>The next step will be to see how well LINE harnesses its subscriber base to promote wares from its retail partners, including Groupon, Lazada, Zalora, Rakuten, Superbuy, H&amp;M and more. With messaging platforms being highly personal, if LINE manages to continue its growth trajectory and strengthen partnerships, it’ll be able to have an edge against competitors in Asia such as WeChat and Kakao Talk.</p>

				<p>WIRED.com reports that <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/12/banned-android-words/">Android’s Google Keyboard is not correcting certain words</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The banned directory includes “butt” and “geek,” all seven of George Carlin’s dirty words, a frat party’s worth of homophobia and misogyny, and is peppered with pornographic sub genres and fetishistically obscure medical terms, like “gonadatrophia” and “irrumination.” Genitalia is banned (with special attention paid to women’s bodies) as well as a mystifying selection of words that aren’t generally considered offensive, like “thud” and “LSAT.”</p>

  <p>Taken as a whole, Google’s list suggests not only a surprising discomfort with sexuality, but also reproductive health and undergarments. Words like “panty,” “braless,” “Tampax,” “lactation,” and “preggers” are censored along with sexual health vocabulary like “uterus” and “STI.”</p>

  <p>“I try to Swype-type the word ‘condom’ and I get ‘condition’ or ‘confusion,’” said Jillian York, a spokesperson for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “There is no context in which that makes any sense. Grow up, Android.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is fun to text my Android-using friends, especially when they are too drunk or tired to check their typos. This is going to take some fun out of it unless they disable the filter.</p>

<p>Its black and white models now comes with rose gold versions that has gold instead of silver accents. It also unveiled a merlot red version.</p>

<p><a href="http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/htc-introduces-gold-colored-htc-one-for-the-masses/">HTC launched a gold version of its HTC One</a> after producing a limited edition in real gold. After launching a limited edition gold Galaxy S4, Samsung is bringing gold to the mass market with the gold Galaxy Note 3.</p>

<p>I think we are way past the debate on whether a gold phone appeals to the public. The gold iPhone 5s has silenced the critics.</p>

<p>Samsung doesn’t seem to understand that a gold plastic phone feels completely different from a gold aluminium phone.</p>
