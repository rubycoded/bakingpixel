				<p>It’s clear that Lavabit is going to be collateral damage in the Snowden case, regardless of the fact whether the email system was as secure as advertised <a href="http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/lavabit-not-as-secure-as-previously-thought/">or not</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/13/5099176/lavabit-owner-10000-fine-snowden-email">US wants $10,000 from Lavabit owner for dodging order for Snowden’s email</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Levison was held in contempt of court and fined $5,000 for every day he did not turn over the keys after the FBI installed a monitoring device on his servers. Without the keys in a “usable electronic format,” the FBI could not read any of the data it was collecting.</p>

  <p>Levison waited two days, racking up $10,000 in sanctions, then turned over the keys and immediately shut down his company. He’s appealing the fine now, arguing that requesting a master set of encryption keys was excessive if the FBI only wanted to monitor one user.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rolling Jubilee, set up by Occupy’s Strike Debt group following the street protests that swept the world in 2011, launched on 15 November 2012. The group purchases personal debt cheaply from banks before “abolishing” it, freeing individuals from their bills.</p>

  <p>By purchasing the debt at knockdown prices the group has managed to free $14,734,569.87 of personal debt, mainly medical debt, spending only $400,000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The group says that this was done to educate the public about the debt industry.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Our purpose in doing this, aside from helping some people along the way – there’s certainly many, many people who are very thankful that their debts are abolished – our primary purpose was to spread information about the workings of this secondary debt market.”</p>

				<p>The Wall Street Journal reports on <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/11/11/motorola-plans-low-cost-phone/">the disappointing sales of Moto X</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to research firm Strategy Analytics, roughly 500,000 Moto X phones were sold in the third quarter, after the phone was released in August. By comparison, Samsung said it sold more than 10 million Galaxy S4 phones within a month of its April release.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is bad news for Motorola. Is Google ready to roll out a Motorola phone that is capable of challenging other Android phones? At the risk of cannibalising its Nexus line?</p>

<p>The following makes me wonder if Google still sees a future for Motorola as a phone maker?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Motorola shipped fewer than 2% of smartphones world-wide in the third quarter, says Strategy Analytics, down from 4% two years ago. One reason is that Google pared Motorola’s product offerings from more than three dozen to just a handful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And as the DOD moves forward with its Mobile Agenda—an effort to largely move from desktop computers to mobile devices—its technology leaders are looking farther afield to make the transition. “This multi-vendor, device-agnostic approach minimizes the impact of [a] single vendor to our current operations,” Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Damien Pickart told Government Executive.</p>

  <p>In other words, BlackBerry is now expendable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once businesses start to move away from BlackBerry, if they haven’t already done so, BlackBerry will be in bigger trouble.</p>

The app asked users to share their usernames and passwords after downloading, turning them into willing participants of a giant social botnet.</p>

<p>This wouldn’t have happened if these people focussed on creating great content that brings likes and followers instead of artificially engineering engagements and readership.</p>

				<p>Bill Gates shares on Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2013/11/bill-gates-wired-essay/all/">his plan to improve the world</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This realization led me to rethink some of my assumptions about how the world improves. I am a devout fan of capitalism. It is the best system ever devised for making self-interest serve the wider interest. This system is responsible for many of the great advances that have improved the lives of billions—from airplanes to air-conditioning to computers.</p>

  <p>But capitalism alone can’t address the needs of the very poor. This means market-driven innovation can actually widen the gap between rich and poor. I saw firsthand just how wide that gap was when I visited a slum in Durban, South Africa, in 2009. Seeing the open-pit latrine there was a humbling reminder of just how much I take modern plumbing for granted. Meanwhile, 2.5 billion people worldwide don’t have access to proper sanitation, a problem that contributes to the deaths of 1.5 million children a year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article is a very good read. Take the time to go through it. And then sit down and reflect upon yourself.</p>

  <p>Custom timelines are a new type of timeline you control: you create the timeline, give it a name, and select which Tweets to add, either by hand or programmatically using the API. Timelines are public, have their own pages on twitter.com, and can easily be embedded on your website. The rest is up to you.</p>

<p>Finally, a way to properly organise the chaos that is twitter timeline. <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/76460-using-twitter-lists">Lists</a> helped to make it keep up with tweets easier but managing our tweets has always been out of our control.</p>

				<p>Daisuke Wakabayashi and Mayumi Negishi report for the Wall Street Journal on <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/article_email/SB10001424052702304672404579185940386164788-lMyQjAxMTAzMDAwNzEwNDcyWj">Japan being Apple’s fastest-growing market in the past two years</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Apple’s brand is just overwhelming here,” said Eiji Mori, a Tokyo-based analyst at BCN Inc. “It’s not about specifications. It’s not about rationale. It’s about owning an iPhone.”</p>

  <p>Two factors in the iPhone’s Japanese success are Japan’s wealth and the degree to which its phone market resembles the U.S., a “postpaid” market where the phones are subsidized by carriers and sold with multiyear contracts. “The U.S. and Japan are unique in that sense,” says Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. analyst Toni Sacconaghi.</p>

  <p>In markets where most consumers pay for the handset upfront, the iPhone’s big price tag damps sales.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is great news for Apple given how the Japanese market is traditionally biased towards Japanese handset makers. And it is also important to note that Japanese tend to shun Samsung because it is a Korean brand.</p>
