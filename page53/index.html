				<p>The Korea Times reports that <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2013/12/133_148788.html">Samsung wants to settle the patent dispute</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Samsung still prefers to sign a comprehensive ‚Äúcross-licensing‚Äù deal, allowing the world‚Äôs biggest smartphone manufacturer to access all Apple‚Äôs design-related, some standard-essential and commercial patents; while Apple is asking Samsung to pay over $30 per device for Samsung‚Äôs patent violations, which Samsung thinks is ‚Äútoo much,‚Äù said another Samsung official who is familiar with the issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing that it is futile to deny infringement, Samsung has decided to license the patents so they can openly copy with no repercussions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.looksgoodworkswell.com/elegance-of-macpaint-code/">Why MacPaint‚Äôs Original Canvas was 416 Pixels Wide</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course one can critique it now and point out well what happens when you add color. And when you have a resizable window? But remember, this was the age of the Mac 128k, running on a 68k at 8Mhz. The ROM itself was just 64k and all of the core graphics (Quickdraw) was squeezed into 24k. This was an algorithm born of necessity. Without this optimization the original MacPaint would have been sluggish in many of its operations (the ScrnToBuf and the BufToScreen are foundational to MacPaint).</p>

				<p>The award winning iOS writing app Writer has recently been in the spotlight for good and bad reasons. The good news is that Information Architects (iA), the company behind Writer, has released Writer Pro, which touts some useful features.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/18/5222948/ia-writer-pro">iA‚Äôs Writer Pro maximizes the minimalist text editor</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Syntax Control is a far more powerful version of the Focus mode in the original Writer, which faded out all sentences except the one that you were working on. Writer Pro lets you do the same thing for different types of words ‚Äî the idea is to make it easier for writers to edit themselves by searching for repeated terms, unnecessary adverbs, and so on. ‚ÄúSyntax Control was planned as an original feature of iA Writer,‚Äù says Reichenstein, ‚Äúbut since it is a feature for editing, not drafting, it never really sat right in the basic concept of iA Writer which was, in one word: just write.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bad news? iA seemed to try and preempt other folks from implementing similar features by indicating that they‚Äôre willing to protect those features via legal battles. Such a stance is underestandable for new features and technology, but the issue is that some of the new features we‚Äôre talking about are intrinsically tied to a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/reference/NSLinguisticTagger_Class/Reference/Reference.html">NSLinguisticTagger Class</a> that Apple has included in iOS for developers to harness. As a result, it‚Äôs hardly surprising that it has sparked off a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/21/5234580/patent-pending-ias-militant-stance-on-syntax-control">healthy debate</a> as to whether they‚Äôre being proactive, or just being jerks about it.</p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/JedMadsen">@JedMadsen</a> Thanks, Jed. It looks obvious now, but it was a tough fight; so tough, that I'm ready to go into another fight to protect it. üôÇ

<p>John Gruber of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> fame tweeted a pretty witty response to the whole deal.</p>

<p>The Internet is becoming increasingly vocal about the whole deal. Marco Arment has <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/12/26/information-architects-threaten-with-patents">chimed in</a>, and many folks are also blatantly <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2013/12/23/no-thanks-ia/">telling others not to support iA</a>.</p>

<p>iA obviously hasn‚Äôt been blind to the whole situation, as the company has apparently backtracked slightly by tweeting that it has dropped its patents pending. The obvious guess would be that this change of heart is related to the suddenly backlash from the Internet, but at least it shows that iA is paying attention.</p>

<p>Love them or hate them. I do like a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/24/3177332/ia-oliver-reichenstein-writer-interview-good-design-is-invisible">previous interview</a> with Oliver Reichenstein, the founder and director of Information Architects, in which he talks about the design and concept of the app.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The principles of good design have not changed. Dieter Rams said: ‚ÄúGood design is as little design as possible. Less, but better ‚Äì because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.‚Äù This applies to all disciplines of design, including web design. Web design looks like graphic design because it appears visually flat, but it is actually closer to electro-mechanical engineering than any form of drawing. As a web designer you need to consider what people do with their hands and heads. You need to design your products in a way that requires minimal input, and delivers maximal output.</p>

				<p>Apple Insider reports on <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/12/24/briefly-japanese-apple-stores-likely-to-kick-off-lucky-bag-sales-on-jan-2">Apple‚Äôs annual ‚Äúlucky bag‚Äù sale in Japan</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As it has done in years past, Apple Stores in Japan will likely start 2014 with sales of <em>Fukubukuro</em>, roughly translated to ‚Äúlucky bags,‚Äù in celebration of the Japanese new year. Apple retail locations across the country are scheduled to open at 8 a.m. local time on Jan. 2, some two hours earlier than usual, strongly hinting at an as yet unannounced sales event, reports Mac Otakara.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what is a <em>Fukubukuro</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In practice, retailers participating in the custom bundle various goods in a bag, which is then sold for a preset price. The contents of each bag can vary, but customers never know exactly what is inside until the package is opened after purchase. If tallied up separately, the products are usually worth more than the package sales price, thereby offering consumers a discount, albeit sight-unseen.</p>

				<p>TechCrunch reports on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/20/selfconsciouschat/">Snapchat‚Äôs new feature that allows replays of its disappearing messages</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My least favorite part of Snapchat is mistakenly opening a video Snap when I can‚Äôt hear it, like in a noisy public place or when my sound is off. Snapchat tried to address that today with an experimental new Replay feature that lets you rewatch one old Snap per day. But by fixing that problem it created a much bigger one. It killed off some of its ephemerality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is Snapchat trying to reposition itself? I would think so. It added its Stories feature back in October to allow users to share posts that disappear after 24 hours. This latest addition is a big bet by Snapchat. Either it will turn out to be a success or it will diminish the appeal of Snapchat, just like how Facebook‚Äôs Timeline and News Feed changes caused huge uproars with its users. However, users are more likely to be less invested in Snapchat than Facebook, making it easier to ditch the service.</p>

				<p>Google <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2013/12/keeping-chrome-extensions-simple.html">announced an update to the Chrome Web Store policy to only allow single-purpose extensions</a>.</p>

<p>Existing extensions that has multiple functions might have to be split into different extensions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To keep with our principle of simplicity, we decided to take a different approach. Chrome extensions would be simple and single-purpose in nature, and each would only be allowed a single visible UI ‚Äúsurface‚Äù in Chrome, a single browser action or page action button. Toolbars wouldn‚Äôt be supported by design, and users would have more control over which features they added to their browser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This initiative is to combat the clutter that builds up when users install many extensions, leading to a cluttered Chrome toolbar.</p>

<p>I loved browser add-ons back when I was on FireFox. However, those made the browser so bloated that when I switched to Chrome, I made a conscious effort to be selective when it comes to installing extensions.</p>

<p>Now, I use Safari with only three extensions. Pocket, Evernote and Buffer. This is the maximum in my new minimalist approach to browser add-ons.</p>

  <p>BlackBerry‚Äôs revenue in the third quarter fell by more than 50% from the same period a year earlier. The company‚Äôs net loss for the quarter topped $4 billion due to restructuring costs and unsold devices. Yes, billion with a ‚Äúb.‚Äù And it barely sold more than 1 million BB10 devices, proving once more that its make-or-break smartphone product line is broken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BlackBerry has decided to fight smaller battles by focussing on markets where they are strong in, such as in Indonesia. I know many Indonesians who love their BlackBerry devices but if the company does no prove to be an attractive alternative to the iPhones or Android devices, it will be a futile move.</p>
