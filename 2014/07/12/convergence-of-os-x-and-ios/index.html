<meta name="description" content="Ben Brooks recently wrote a good article on using an iPad as his main machine, it’s something that has been attempted by many folks in the past, but I like his take on it. As I said, this is a setup I am likely to use more and more. With iOS 8 extensions coming I think the gap between what most people need to do on a Mac each day, and what the iPad can do well, is closing faster than many suspect. At this point it’s not a person clamoring for better apps, that do more powerful things, it’s just a matter of fine tuning what we already have. I don’t see that taking very long. In fact, this time next year I may be splitting my time between the Mac and iPad evenly. One thing that came to mind was the fact that OS X and iOS 8 and being linked closer than ever before. It wasn’t too long ago that people were debating if we needed a full desktop operating system on our mobile devices. Microsoft tried that with Windows 8, and is still trying to fine tune the product.
