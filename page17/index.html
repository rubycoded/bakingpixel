  <p>Over time, iMessage has become indispensable in my everyday life. If the gadgets I have to carry with me on a daily basis are the bones of my tech existence, iMessage is the connective tissue. It’s quick work chats; it’s sharing location on the way to a meeting or dinner; it’s sending a GIF of a hug to a friend who is having a bad day; it’s keeping in touch with mom; it’s getting a series of poop emojis from my niece on her iPod Touch.</p>

<p>This might be the case in the West, but in Asia, the alternatives such as Whatsapp, WeChat, and LINE still reign supreme. In Malaysia where I live, Whatsapp is the de facto messaging system everybody uses.</p>

<p>One thing that always has me scratching my head is that why Google can’t seem to roll out a proper competitor to this. Sure, now we have <a href="https://allo.google.com">Google Allo</a>, but while I hope it works out, I don’t have much confidence that it’ll be a success anytime soon.</p>

  <p>The Pixel charges via USB-C, and uses USB-PD (Power Direct) to pull a whopping 7 hours of battery life in fifteen minutes from its 18W charger when starting with a near-dead smartphone. (USB-PD, like most quick-charging solutions, scales down the power draw depending on how badly your smartphone is hurting for battery life.) Combine that with the Pixel’s 2770mAh battery, and Google’s smartphone is not only going to last longer, but come back from the dead much more quickly than either of Apple’s smartphone options.</p>

  <p>The thing is, Apple has quick-charge technology in the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and its various mobile accessories; the company is also no stranger to USB-C, having used it in the MacBook. It may not have been feasible to stick that kind of quick-charging into the iPhone 7 given time and resource constraints, but that only makes me more greedy for it in next year’s iPhone. The age of slow-charge batteries is coming to a close, and I can only hope that Google is heralding the call.</p>

<p>Serenity Caldwell wrote a <a href="http://www.imore.com/five-things-apple-can-learn-from-made-by-google-event">good piece</a> on the #MadeByGoogle event, but while I wasn’t too bothered about the camera on the Pixel, I really wish that proper quick charging would be implemented on the iPhone.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2016/07/03/on-apple-music-and-spotify/">On Apple Music and Spotify</a></h2>

				<p>There’s been some <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/1/12082398/apple-music-spotify-app-store-legal-feud">noise</a> recently between Apple and Spotify, which shouldn’t be surprising, considering they’re currently in the midst of fighting to be the king of music streaming.</p>

<p>I just figured I’d toss my two cents in too.</p>

<p>While pricing and content is obviously one of the key factors to the outcome of this, I feel Apple really needs to double down on the interface of iTunes and Music (on iOS). It’s currently hell to navigate. With iOS 10 and macOS Sierra around the corner, things should be getting better, but there really needs to be less <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/05/13/caldwell-itunes-bug">horror stories</a> about iTunes/Apple Music messing with your music library. I personally have stopped using iTunes and Apple Music, since it totally poisoned my music library. I was already dabbling with Spotify then, but I’m all in now. I’m more than happy to revisit Apple Music when Apple gets its act together, but on the current trajectory, it doesn’t seem that it’ll happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>Seriously.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on several Apple Support threads, it appears that the most recent version of iTunes 12.3.3 contains a database error that affects a small number of users, and can potentially wipe out their music collection after the update. The error has been mentioned a few times, primarily on the Windows side, in the weeks since the 12.3.3 update, but appears to be rare enough that it hasn’t previously received major press. Apple did put out a support document shortly after the 12.3.3 update that walks you through some fixes if you find that your local copies of music are missing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Focus should really not be on having anything like the above happen, instead of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/1/12073668/why-apple-buying-tidal-makes-sense">maybe buying Tidal</a>.</p>

				<p>Electronic Frontier Foundation released a press release on <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/google-deceptively-tracks-students-internet-browsing-eff-says-complaint-federal-trade">Google tracking students’ internet browsing</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Google does not use student data for targeted advertising within a subset of Google sites, EFF found that Google’s “Sync” feature for the Chrome browser is enabled by default on Chromebooks sold to schools. This allows Google to track, store on its servers, and data mine for non-advertising purposes, records of every Internet site students visit, every search term they use, the results they click on, videos they look for and watch on YouTube, and their saved passwords. Google doesn’t first obtain permission from students or their parents and since some schools require students to use Chromebooks, many parents are unable to prevent Google’s data collection.</p>

  <p>Google’s practices fly in the face of commitments made when it signed the Student Privacy Pledge, a legally enforceable document whereby companies promise to refrain from collecting, using, or sharing students’ personal information except when needed for legitimate educational purposes or if parents provide permission.</p>

  <p>“Despite publicly promising not to, Google mines students’ browsing data and other information, and uses it for the company’s own purposes. Making such promises and failing to live up to them is a violation of FTC rules against unfair and deceptive business practices,” said EFF Staff Attorney Nate Cardozo. “Minors shouldn’t be tracked or used as guinea pigs, with their data treated as a profit center. If Google wants to use students’ data to ‘improve Google products,’ then it needs to get express consent from parents.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the question everybody should be asking is why would you want to buy an iPad Pro for nearly $1,000 when you can buy another device, such as the Microsoft Surface Pro, for almost the same price and be able to use a full desktop operating system? iOS worked on the original iPad because tablets with desktop operating systems had poor battery life and poor software features. Now, that’s changed. Apple needs to get with the times. Sure, you can run Photoshop. But can you run a full desktop version of Photoshop? The answer is no. Sure, you can edit movies in iMovie. But can you edit movies with professional software like Final Cut Pro? Unfortunately, you can’t.</p>

<p>This guy probably missed how people are using iOS apps to create high quality photos, drawings, videos and music.</p>

				<p>John Gruber wrote about <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2015/11/what_goes_up">Bryan Clark’s article about Apple on TheNextWeb</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the part of Clark’s piece that got my attention. It’s a common refrain these days — just search Google for “Apple is too dependent on the iPhone”.</p>

  <p>Clark makes it sound like this is because the rest of Apple’s business is in decline, whereas the truth is that the iPhone continues to grow at an astonishing rate that even Apple’s other successful products can’t match. Is it worrisome that iPad sales continue to decline? Sure. Would it be better for Apple if the iPad were selling in iPhone-esque quantities? Of course. But iPad still sold 9.9 million units and generated $4.3 billion in revenue last quarter.</p>

  <p>Arguing that Apple is in trouble because the iPhone is so popular is like arguing that the ’90s-era Chicago Bulls were in trouble because Michael Jordan was so good. It’s true Jordan couldn’t play forever — and the iPhone won’t be the most profitable product in the world forever. But in the meantime, the Bulls were well-nigh unbeatable, and Apple, for now at least, is unfathomably profitable.1 Just like how it’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, it’s better to have tremendous success for some period of time than never to have had tremendous success in the first place. Right?</p>

  <p>What I don’t get is why Apple gets singled out for its singular success, but other companies don’t. 92 percent of Google’s revenue last year came from online advertising. And more importantly, I don’t get why Apple’s non-iPhone businesses are so quickly written off only because they’re so much smaller than the iPhone.</p>

  <p>Apple’s total revenue for last quarter was $51.5 billion. The iPhone accounted for $32.2 billion of that, which means Apple’s non-iPhone business generated about $19.3 billion in revenue. All of Microsoft in the same three months: around $21 billion. All of Google: $18.78 billion. Facebook: $4.5 billion. Take away every single iPhone sold — all of them — and Apple’s remaining business for the quarter was almost as big as Microsoft’s, bigger than Google’s, and more than four times the size of Facebook’s. And this is for the July-September quarter, not the October-December holiday quarter in which Apple is strongest.</p>

<p>My guess is that these “journalists” want to drive traffic to their articles and it is easy to mislead uninformed readers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You can just look around and see all the data breaches that are going on. These things are becoming more frequent,” Cook told the Daily Telegraph. “They can not only result in privacy breaches but also security issues. We believe very strongly in end-to-end encryption and no back doors. We don’t think people want us to read their messages. We don’t feel we have the right to read their emails.</p>

  <p>“Any back door is a back door for everyone. Everybody wants to crack down on terrorists. Everybody wants to be secure. The question is how. Opening a back door can have very dire consequences.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2012, Google executives were reported to be upset with the lack of interest in Google Music, and particularly dismayed its inability to bring in revenue. One aspect that hurt its adoption was the lack of a mobile app for iOS.</p>

  <p>That means Google Music is a lot like Google Wallet: years ahead of Apple, but so poorly planned and implemented that it completely squandered its vast head start.</p>

  <p>Google apparently expected its paid on-demand streaming music service to be quite popular among Android users, but instead got a taste of what its Android developers had already been eating: the platform does not attract people who want to pay for things, particularly not anything that can be pirated. Google Music mostly demonstrated the weakness of Android as a platform for supporting commercial apps and services.</p>

<p>On the other hand, these users are willing to sit through ads to use the services for free.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consumer Watchdog had petitioned the FCC to “initiate a rulemaking proceeding requiring ‘edge providers’ (like Google, Facebook, YouTube, Pandora, Netflix, and LinkedIn) to honor ‘Do Not Track’ Requests from consumers.” The group’s proposed rule would prevent online services from requiring consumers to consent to tracking in exchange for accessing Web services, preventing online services from sharing personal information of users with third parties when consumers send Do Not Track requests.</p>

  <p>When consumers enable the Do Not Track setting in their browsers, they send an HTTP header in an attempt to opt out of third-party tracking conducted by analytics services, advertising networks, and social platforms. Some companies have committed to honor Do Not Track requests, but they are mostly ignored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The solution is to stop using these websites and use ad-blocking tools that also block tracking. Instead of Google, <a href="http://bakingpixel.com/2015/07/duckduckgo-bangs/">switch to DuckDuckGo</a>.</p>
