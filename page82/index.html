				<p>Ed Dale thinks Apple’s soft launch of the Retina iPad mini <a href="http://www.eddale.co/general/smart-move-apple">was a brilliant move</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By soft releasing the iPad Mini Retina, Apple achieved three crucial things.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple’s biggest fans got theirs first. Who knew about this first? The people who follow the Apple blogs and digerati. Judging by Twitter, this worked perfectly.</li>
    <li>The grey market queing for the iPad Mini Retina was going to be immense. By going online the incredibly poor optics (The front of Apple lines, which attracts a lot of media, was full of people who were not fans but paid to be there) are mitigated.</li>
    <li>The last thing Apple wants is 100’s of customers turning up everyday to be dissapointed in a store which is meant to be a happy place – Apple does not want their stores to be associated with disappointment and frustration!!</li>
  </ul>

				<p>Autopia reports on <a href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/11/elon-musk-pickup-plane/">Elon Musk‘s plans for an electric pickup and supersonic jet</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the New York Times DealBook conference, Musk said there’s an “interesting opportunity to make a supersonic vertical takeoff landing jet,” something he began to envision after the Concorde service ended nearly a decade ago.</p>

  <p>Modeled after the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. — the Ford F-150 — Musk envisions a truck oriented towards consumers rather than fleets. But first, Tesla has to deliver its Model X SUV and its third-generation, mass-market EV in 2017.</p>

				<p>Mashable reports how <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/11/14/whats-next-for-evernote/">Evernote will be able to learn your habits in the future</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For Evernote, utilizing this data means teaching the app how to learn the habits of its users. For example, if a user has her weekly project meeting on the calendar each Tuesday, Evernote should be able to surface her meeting notes for her, or even prepare a blank note in preparation for the meeting without any work from the user.</p>

  <p>“We want to make Evernote better at reorganizing itself to suit the way that you use it,” he says. “To wrap itself around your brain.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is something all apps should strive towards. Having an app that knows my habit well will make it very hard for me to want to switch to a different app. This will be great for user retention.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Late yesterday, a new version of Google Search hit the Play Store for everyone running Android 4.1 and higher—Google Search version 3.1. All the Google Home code was completely intact, meaning that Google just shipped its new launcher out to every modern Android phone. In order for Google Home to work, it requires a tiny enabler app that comes with the Nexus 5. The enabler app isn’t being shipped out to these other devices, so while 99 percent of the code is now on everyone’s device (or it will be when the rollout finishes), it’s disabled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why include the code but not enable the function?</p>

				<p>Aside from the cheeky, and possibly misleading name, Coin is a product that could go a long way to helping us solve the issue of fat wallets. After all, why carry so many pieces of plastic when you can just carry one? It’ll have additional hurdles in countries where security chips are implemented in cards, instead of just relying on the magnetic stripe. The good news is that the folks behind Coin are already aware of this and working to offer support for chip and pin future versions.</p>

<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/11/14/tired-of-a-fat-wallet-coin-lets-you-hold-all-your-cards-in-a-single-connected-card/">Tired of a fat wallet? Coin lets you hold all your cards in a single connected card</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a brief demo of Coin’s technology, I can confirm that it actually works: Simply swipe your cards using a card dongle like Square’s and Coin’s app securely stores all of the card information for you. You can hold up to eight cards on the Coin card at once, which you can cycle through using a small button and display on the front of the card. Paying is as simple as swiping like a normal credit card.</p>

				<p>This finally solves the issue of Dropbox only supporting one account per desktop. It’s a good move and makes it easier for companies to adopt Dropbox and help it continue its push to make traditional file servers redundant.</p>

  <p>Though the engineering behind the new Dropbox for Business is apparently quite complex, the end result is simple: a new, separate Dropbox folder for your work stuff. You still log into your Dropbox account as you always would. The difference is that your IT guy has access to — and control over — the new work folder.</p>

  <p>I left Microsoft in 2006 because I knew there wasn’t a product pipeline. Since then, what has Microsoft done that’s truly innovative? Kinect is the only thing that comes to mind. Really horrid for a company that has 90,000 smart people.</p>
