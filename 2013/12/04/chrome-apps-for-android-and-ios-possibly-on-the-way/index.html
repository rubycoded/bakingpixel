<meta name="description" content="Google’s release of Chrome packaged apps was undoubtedly a trojan horse into the Windows and Mac OS platforms. The feature allows Chrome web-based apps to look as if they’re running without the Chrome browser, and also offer better offline support and connection with hardware. Such a move allowed Windows and Mac users a taste of what life would be like on a Chromebook. Now the search giant could be looking to repeat the feature on Android and iOS, if the recent discovery of some code on the GitHub repository is any indication. So far Google has declined to comment on the subject, and it could well be just another test project that Google is working on, but you never know. Google’s strategy has always been to get its products and services on as many platforms and devices as it can. Google is building Chrome apps support for Android and iOS, beta release coming as soon as January 2014 The toolkit will help developers create Android and iOS hybrid native apps with Chrome app polyfills, through Apache Cordova. The steps include modifying for mobile design, fixing bugs, working around limitations, and of course, testing. After all the work is done, Google says the apps will be good enough to publish to both Google Play and Apple’s App Store. The requirements suggest Android 4.x will be supported initially, although Cordova could work with Android 2.2 and 2.3 as well. iOS support is still marked as “TBA” but development has already started." />
