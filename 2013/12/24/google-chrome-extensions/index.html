<meta name="description" content="Google announced an update to the Chrome Web Store policy to only allow single-purpose extensions. Existing extensions that has multiple functions might have to be split into different extensions. To keep with our principle of simplicity, we decided to take a different approach. Chrome extensions would be simple and single-purpose in nature, and each would only be allowed a single visible UI “surface” in Chrome, a single browser action or page action button. Toolbars wouldn’t be supported by design, and users would have more control over which features they added to their browser. This initiative is to combat the clutter that builds up when users install many extensions, leading to a cluttered Chrome toolbar. I loved browser add-ons back when I was on FireFox. However, those made the browser so bloated that when I switched to Chrome, I made a conscious effort to be selective when it comes to installing extensions. Now, I use Safari with only three extensions. Pocket, Evernote and Buffer. This is the maximum in my new minimalist approach to browser add-ons." />
