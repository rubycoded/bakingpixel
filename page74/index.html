				<p>If this move happened a few years ago, BlackBerry’s BBM could have owned the mobile messaging scene. <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/the-inside-story-of-why-blackberry-is-failing/article14563602/?page=all">Disputes and infighting</a> prevented that. Targeting developing markets is a good move, though BlackBerry will now have to contend with other messaging giants such as WeChat, Viber, LINE, and several more. LINE in particular just passed the <a href="http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/lines-300-million-users-will-be-a-problem-for-whatsapp/">300 million</a> user mark.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/bbm-will-be-preinstalled-some-android-smartphones-blackberry-says">BBM will be preinstalled on some Android smartphones, BlackBerry says</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BlackBerry this morning announced that BBM will be preloaded on some Android smartphones starting in December. The specific models weren’t named — BlackBerry said “from leading [original equipment manufacturers]” — but you’ll be able to find them in Africa, India, Indonesia, Latin America and the MIddle East.</p>

				<p>Android is improving all the time, and the new phone dialer with build-in search is pretty awesome. Strangely enough, despite the effort to reduce the memory footprint, my Nexus 4 feels slower after the update.</p>

<p><a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/11/25/how-google-shrunk-android-for-version-44-kitkat#awesm=~ooilG5CQ9blkwR">How Google Shrank Android For Version 4.4 KitKat</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The goal of Project Svelte was basically to reduce the memory footprint to fit into 512 megs. The way we did it by the way, which we didn’t talk about, was to take a Nexus 4 and adapted it to run at 512 megs,” Burke said.</p>

				<p>This is a great article. All I can say is that you should read it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations/">Software Is Reorganizing the World</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And this global technology cloud truly stretches over the whole earth, touching down at various locales both in the U.S. — at Sendgrid in Boulder, Tumblr in New York, Rackspace in Austin, Snapchat in L.A., Zipcar in Boston, Opscode in Seattle — and outside it — at Skype in Estonia, Tencent in Shenzhen, Soundcloud in Germany, Flipkart in India, Spotify in Sweden, Line in Tokyo, and Waze in Israel. Cultural connections forming between people in this cloud are becoming stronger than the connections between their geographic neighbors. Palo Alto’s Accel invests in India’s Flipkart, Estonia’s Skype is folded into Seattle’s Microsoft, Israel’s Waze is merged into Mountain View’s Google, and the SoundCloud engineer on a laptop in Berlin builds a deeper relationship with the VC in New York than the nearby Bavarian bank.</p>

  <p>Today, the geocenter of the global technology cloud is still hovering over Silicon Valley. But in a world where technology is making location increasingly less important, tomorrow the reverse diaspora may well assemble somewhere else.</p>

				<p>WhatsApp had an early start in the mobile messaging game, but it’s refusal (or delay) to support desktop messaging or stickers might come back to haunt it. If WhatApp doesn’t take some massive action soon, it runs the risk of being left behind in the wake of newer messaging systems from Asia.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company has resolutely stuck to its singular vision of being an over-the-top messaging provider that works across platforms and devices. Even adding voice messaging, which Line, WeChat, and others have had for many months, was a big deal for the minimalist app. It makes money only by charging users 99 cents a year.</p>

				<p>Newegg has won the fight against patent trolls before, but it loses this round. Next up will be the appeal.</p>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/jury-newegg-infringes-spangenberg-patent-must-pay-2-3-million/">Jury: Newegg infringes Spangenberg patent, must pay $2.3 million</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TQP’s single patent is tied to a failed modem business run by Michael Jones, formerly president of Telequip. The company has acquired more than $45 million in patent licensing fees by getting settlements from a total of 139 companies. TQP argues that the patent covers SSL or TLS combined with the RC4 cipher, a common Internet security system used by retailers like Newegg.</p>

				<p>The Business Insider reports that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-17-million-cookie-settlement-2013-11">Google has to pay $17 million for privacy violation</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The case began in 2011 and 2012 when the states discovered tracking of Safari users after visits to Google’s DoubleClick ad network. Cookies are small files embedded in a computer that contain trace amounts of data based on visitor history. Based on the information they have, cookies offer its clients the ability to make tailored Web pages. In the statement given by Schneiderman, he said that Google directly violated customers privacy who deserve the right to know if someone is following them while they browse the Web. He continued by asserting that Google had violated several privacy laws as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why target Safari in particular? Does this mean that Google is already tracking your data on Chrome and other browsers?</p>

				<p>WIRED.com writes about <a href="http://www.wired.com/design/2013/11/stereopublic-an-app-to-help-you-find-peace-and-quiet/">Stereopublic, a crowd-sourced app to find peace and quiet</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stereopublic’s creator, Jason Sweeney, explains Stereopublic as an app that navigates users through a city based on noise—in this case the lack thereof. “It was very personal desire to think of future cities as having dedicated quiet spaces that were either built into them or to nurture those spaces that already existed,” he says. “So the idea for the app came about when thinking of a way to make a ‘quiet-seeking’ tool that the public could freely access to participate in this quest for quiet.”</p>

  <p>The idea is that as users walk around a city, they geo-tag their favorite quiet spots. You can add a picture, record an audio file and file the spot under different mood categories depending on how you’re feeling, essentially creating an interactive map of the most peaceful spots in a city.</p>

  <p>The service is now available to all IDrive users (including those on the free 5GB plan) and once all the data from Facebook is backed up, users can access their images and videos from any web browser and the company’s iOS app. An Android app, the company tells me, is “coming soon” and all the data is automatically encrypted with what IDrive calls “an NSA-proof private key option.”</p>

<p>In case someone decides to block you on Facebook, you can still access the photos you were tagged in.</p>
