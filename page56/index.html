				<p>Tech in Asia reports that <a href="http://www.techinasia.com/xiaomis-beta-smart-wi-fi-router-costs-15-cents-but-youve-got-to-build-it-yourself/">Xiaomi has announced the beta launch of its wifi router</a>. In this case, beta means you have to build the router yourself. Only 500 units are available at RMB 1 each.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Xiaomi has gained mass appeal in mainland China for its ability to satisfy users across the broad spectrum of Android, ranging from customization geeks to would-be Apple fans. Of course, the former group would likely be more interested in a build-it-yourself router than the latter. However, Xiaomi might be hoping that once this mundane hunk of silicon and plastic gets in the hands of a few dedicated users, excitement will spread, and so will the router.</p>

				<p>FireEye reports on <a href="http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/botnet-activities-research/2013/12/misosms.html">a mobile botnet called MisoSMS that is stealing SMS data from Android phones</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MisoSMS infects Android systems by deploying a class of malicious Android apps. The mobile malware masquerades as an Android settings app used for administrative tasks. When executed, it secretly steals the user’s personal SMS messages and emails them to a command-and-control (CnC) infrastructure hosted in China. FireEye Mobile Threat Prevention platform detects this class of malware as “Android.Spyware.MisoSMS.”</p>

<p>Seems like the majority of infected devices are in Korea. Still, Android users should remain alert.</p>

				<p>Tech in Asia reports about <a href="http://www.techinasia.com/airhelp-disappointed-passengers-money-airlines/">AirHelp, a service that helps passengers claim compensation from airlines</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Airhelp believes that “you could be entitled to compensation of €250 to €600 ($344 to $826) if your flight is delayed by more than three hours, cancelled, or overbooked.” These claims can be filed even if the case goes back up to three years. Airhelp collects as many compensation claims as possible, processes them, and will take 25 percent commission out of every successful claim.</p>

  <p>Co-founder and CEO Henrik Zillmer first got the idea when his flight got delayed for more than three hours and he wasn’t informed about his passenger rights. And when he found out about his rights, he was hit by a maze of links on the airline website when wanting to submit his claim. Afterwards, he did not hear back from the airline.</p>

  <p>According to his research, “more than 20 million passengers every year are entitled to compensation (an average of €450 ($620) per passenger) but less than one percent actually get the compensation mainly because air passengers don’t know their rights and because airlines don’t inform them and make it as difficult as possible to claim it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might be owed compensation that your airline did not inform you about. Or the airlines might force you to jump through a series of hoops before they finally pay you. Airhelp is here to, well, help you.</p>

				<p>Monday Note writes about <a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/2013/12/15/shameless-carriers/">shameless carriers</a>.</p>

<p>In response to Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T’s CEO, predicting the end of subsidies because “wireless operators can no longer afford to suck up the costs of customers’ devices”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know if Stephenson is speaking out of cultural deafness or cynicism, but he’s obscuring the point: There is no subsidy. Carriers extend a loan that users pay back as part of the monthly service payment. Like any loan shark, the carrier likes its subscriber to stay indefinitely in debt, to always come back for more, for a new phone and its ever-revolving payments stream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, some carriers are offering a cheaper contract if you choose to pay for the phone in full.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the meantime, AT&amp;T has finally followed T-Mobile’s initiative and has unbundled the service cost from the handset. If you pay full price for your smartphone, an AT&amp;T contract will cost you $15 less than with a subsidized phone on a 2-year agreement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mobile carriers know that they are overcharging customers. It has taken an “un-carrier” like T-Mobile to <a href="http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/t-mobile-wireless/">make drastic changes</a> to get other carriers switching from existing practices. Carriers believe they can get away with it because customers are tied to contracts.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, my telco called to offer me a S$4 discount per month because I have not renewed my contract. It sounded like a nice gesture until the lady went on the explain that should I cancel my line, I would have to pay the company back. So if I enjoyed the discount for five months and then cancel my line, I would have to pay them $20. They might call it a discount but it sure doesn‘t sound like one.</p>

<p>This is just another way for them to deter subscribers from terminating their lines, just like how they use a phone contract to tie down customers for two years.</p>

				<p>Digital Trends reports that <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/target-severs-ties-beyonce-digital-first-album-release/">Target is refusing to sell Beyoncé’s self-titled album because it was first released digitally</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Releasing a statement about the company’s disinterest in the new album, Target spokesperson Erica Julkowski said “At Target, we focus on offering our guests a wide assortment of physical CDs, and when a new album is available digitally before it is available physically, it impacts demand and sales projections.” </p>

  <p>Julkowski continued “While there are many aspects that contribute to our approach and we have appreciated partnering with Beyoncé in the past, we are primarily focused on offering CDs that will be available in a physical format at the same time as all other formats. At this time, Target will not be carrying Beyoncé’s new self-titled album ‘Beyonce.’“</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is this different from when an album is first released on CDs? Consumers can still choose to download digital copies if they have no intention of paying.</p>

				<p>A common barb thrown at Apple is that the company uses outdated hardware and sells them at premium prices. If you look at things like the Retina Display, TouchID, and many more, you’ll know that the statement isn’t true.</p>

<p>We recently <a href="http://bakingpixel.com/2013/12/qualcomm-introduces-64-bit-chips-with-integrated-lte/">confirmed</a> that Qualcomm should be offering 64-bit chips in the second half of 2014, which is roughly a year after Apple introduced the 64-bit A7 processor. At the very least, it’s good to see that Apple’s move is increasing the speed that new competing devices will have 64-bit processors, which is a benefit to consumers.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/uattr/qualcomm-apple-64-bit-chip-hit-us-in-gut">Qualcomm Insider: Apple 64-Bit Chip `Hit Us in the Gut’</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The 64-bit Apple chip hit us in the gut,” says the Qualcomm employee. “Not just us, but everyone, really. We were slack-jawed, and stunned, and unprepared. It’s not that big a performance difference right now, since most current software won’t benefit. But in Spinal Tap terms it’s like, 32 more, and now everyone wants it.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>M-commerce isn’t a new idea for other chat apps too — Japanese messaging service Line has, for example, dabbled in selling items via its app. Just yesterday, it announced it was going to hold a flash sale for users in Thailand via a partnership with all-in-one e-commerce logistics firm aCommerce and L’Oreal’s Maybelline New York.</p>

  <p>However, as Chinese Internet giant Tencent also owns payment service Tenpay, WeChat’s team can easily tap on the technology to settle the necessary backend work. Tencent already rolled out an update to Weixin in August, incorporating payment services. All users have to do is link an online banking account to Weixin to pay for items and they are good to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg. Tencent can also tap on location data to push location-specific deals to users and allow them to pay using their phone. There is a lot of potential in that without even factoring in the impact of iBeacons.</p>

  <p>For a large, established company, having to use an executive recruiter to find its next CEO carries a profoundly bad aroma. It means that the directors failed at one of their most important duties: succession planning. Behind this first failure, a second one lurks: The Board probably gave the previous CEO free rein to promote and fire subordinates in a way that prevented successors from emerging.</p>

				<p>We’ve all heard how the U.S. patent system can be incredibly frustrating, but it’s probably worse than you think.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/12/the_simple_fix_that_could_heal_the_patent_system.single.html">The Power of No. This simple change could fix the patent system—but it’ll never happen.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What was the great inventive step that convinced the patent examiner to finally issue a patent, the inventive step that is apparently worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Samsung? Apple added the word “continuous” to the patent claims: To unlock the cellphone under Apple’s patent, the user’s finger had to maintain continuous contact as it moved across the touch screen. It appears that Apple had worn the patent examiner down. Of course, the prior patents implicitly involved continuous motion without explicitly using that language. And people using Neonode’s phone had kept their fingers continuously in contact with the touch screen. But this language tweak gave the examiner a fig leaf to cover his weak justification for granting the patent. This was still a patent that should not have been issued. But the grant had consequences: Four months after the patent was issued, Apple sued Samsung.</p>
