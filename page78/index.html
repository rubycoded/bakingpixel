				<p>Reuters reports that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-sells-800000-galaxy-gear-watches-2013-11">Samsung is saying it has sold 800,000 Galaxy Gear, making it the world’s most popular smartwatch</a>.</p>

<p>Does the figure exclude Galaxy Gear sets that consumers get for free when they buy a Galaxy Note 3? I think not.</p>

<p>Update: I forgot to link to an earlier article about <a href="http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/article/2219/galaxy-round-gear-are-revolutionary-products-just-pilots">poor sales of the Galaxy Gear</a>. The article reports that “this product has cumulative sales under 50,000, with daily sales of only 800-900 units”. Samsung’s figure is the number of Galaxy Gear shipped, not the number sold.</p>

				<p>A user claims that his <a href="http://doctorbeet.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/lg-smart-tvs-logging-usb-filenames-and.html">LG Smart TV is sending his viewing information to LG</a>.</p>

<p>He found an LG video pitching to potential advertisers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LG Smart Ad analyses users favourite programs, online behaviour, search keywords and other information to offer relevant ads to target audiences. For example, LG Smart Ad can feature sharp suits to men, or alluring cosmetics and fragrances to women.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, LG Smart Ad offers useful and various advertising performance reports. That live broadcasting ads cannot. To accurately identify actual advertising effectiveness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The TV settings has an option to turn “Collection of watching info” ON or OFF. But he found that the data was still transmitted regardless of the setting.</p>

<p>When he asked LG for comments about it, the company directed him to the retailer he bought the TV from instead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The advice we have been given is that unfortunately as you accepted the Terms and Conditions on your TV, your concerns would be best directed to the retailer. We understand you feel you should have been made aware of these T’s and C’s at the point of sale, and for obvious reasons LG are unable to pass comment on their actions.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201311/profiles.cfm">The American Physical Society interviewed Elon Musk.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But even if someone has no intention of ultimately being a physicist, I still believe that the training of physics is excellent. So as they’re going through their academic career I would recommend studying physics as a good base and then a broad range of engineering courses and then some degree of specialization in an engineering field where it fulfills someone’s interest, and then arts and sciences courses, particularly history. And a few business courses are helpful so you at least know the terminology. You can probably do it with one accounting course, [although] I hate accounting. It’s worth it to have some business courses but you don’t need too many. And I wouldn’t recommend an MBA. I’d say no MBA needed. An MBA is a bad idea.</p>

  <p>It teaches people all sorts of wrong things. They don’t teach people to think in MBA schools. And the top MBA schools are the worst. Because they actually teach people that you must be special, and it causes people to close down their feedback loop and not rigorously examine when they are wrong.</p>

  <p>I hire people in spite of an MBA, not because of one. If you look at the senior managers of my companies, you’ll see very few MBAs there.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
		
				<p>SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory reports that <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2013-11-17-scientists-invent-self-healing-battery.aspx">scientists have invented an electrode that heals itself</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To make the self-healing coating, scientists deliberately weakened some of the chemical bonds within polymers – long, chain-like molecules with many identical units. The resulting material breaks easily, but the broken ends are chemically drawn to each other and quickly link up again, mimicking the process that allows biological molecules such as DNA to assemble, rearrange and break down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has profound implications should it prove to be a practical solution as such batteries are used by electric cars, cameras, mobile devices and other gadgets. These batteries will be able to go through more recharge cycles and it might mean we no longer need to have to change batteries. Manufacturers could choose to make the batteries not removable, and concentrate on crafting a seamless design.</p>

				<p>TechCrunch reports that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/21/twitter-web-redesign/">Twitter is testing a new look for its website</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alone, those changes add up to a cleaner, more modern look for the site, but there are a few other significant changes, too. That includes the new prominent placement of the Twitter logo, which also occupies a prime seat in the middle of the navigation bar in the current design, but which is just slightly visible via different shading (it’s essentially darker grey on dark grey). There’s also a new compose window at the top of the main Twitter feed, which harkens back to earlier versions of the UI, and supplements the compose button in the top right corner of the navigation bar, which remains in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks more like small tweaks of the current look.</p>
