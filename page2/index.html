<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve noticed two separate things:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>If I know the right Reddit or Stack Exchange to search, or if Amazon or Hacker News applies, I get much more useful results than searching Google (or any other general search engine). This avoids SEO spam issues and can surface posts that don’t seem to be accessible otherwise.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Google results, at least for me, are no longer trustworthy, in the sense that I always wonder whether something is missing. Sometimes it does a great job. But sometimes the page I want will not be in the results at all, whereas it’s at the top of the list in Bing.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, whereas I used to rely almost exclusively on Google, I now do site-specific searches where possible. Otherwise, I use Bing by default and Google as a backup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For me DuckDuckGo is the go to, but if I’m searching for coding topics, I would use Stack Overflow. I’ll have to try using Stack Exchange and Reddit more.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting trend, especially how it is very similar in China. Due to the closed nature of manu platforms in China, Chinese users actually search in different apps for different topics. But a popular place for finding answers to certain questions would be <a href="/https-en.wikipedia.org-wiki-zhihu/">Zhihu</a>, the Chinese equivalent of Stack Exchange and Quora.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douban">Douban</a> is very popular for movies, drams and books. I’ve personally found movie and drama ratings to be very accurate on Douban. This is similar to Rotten Tomatoes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Until now, apps have been able to rely on Apple’s Identifier for Advertiser (IDFA) to track users for targeting and advertising purposes. With the launch of iOS 14.5 this week, mobile apps now have to ask users who have upgraded to iOS 14.5 for permission to gather tracking data. With opt-in rates expected to be low, this change is expected to create challenges for personalized advertising and attribution, impacting the $189 billion mobile advertising industry worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The numbers so far is 96% opt-out in the US, 88% opt-out worldwide.</p>

<p>I’m curious to know which countries have the highest opt-in rates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yahoo and AOL, kings of the early internet, saw their fortunes decline as Silicon Valley raced ahead to create new digital platforms. Google replaced Yahoo. AOL was supplanted by cable giants. Now they will become the property of private equity. Verizon, their current owner, agreed to sell them to Apollo Global Management in a deal worth $5 billion, the companies announced Monday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/04/yahoo-aol-verizon-5b">John Gruber</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2002, Yahoo had the chance to buy Google for $1 billion; they hesitated and walked away when the price went to $3 billion. (Same story says they nearly bought Facebook for $1 billion in 2006 and could’ve had it for $1.1 billion.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In January 2000, AOL acquired Time-Warner for $182 billion to form a mega media company then valued at $350 billion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a decline.</p>

<p>Maybe everyone should try Facebook’s advertising platform at least once so they can understand the kind of data that’s being collected about them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a way to convince users to enable tracking across other apps and websites, Facebook is deploying the tactic of telling users that they must enable tracking as part of the App Tracking Transparency framework in iOS 14.5 if they want to help keep Facebook and Instagram “free of charge.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are they threatening to charge people if they don’t allow Facebook to track them? Please do your friends a favour and remind them to opt out. If you know anyone who might be misled by this, especially the elderly and less tech-savvy, please take the time to help them out.</p>

  <p>By default, the Zoom Rooms computer will restart on Saturday, but you can also select a day for the restart.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to deal with the memory leaks, Zoom decides to just force you to restart your computer weekly.</p>

<p>This is a stark contrast to the Chinese market where new car companies and brands keep popping up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A billion people now have iPhones. According to my estimate, Apple surpassed the billion iPhone users milestone last month. Thirteen years after going on sale, the iPhone remains the perennial most popular and best-selling smartphone. Competitors continue to either shamelessly copy iPhone or, at a minimum, be heavily influenced by the iPhone. Looking ahead, Apple’s top priorities for the iPhone include finding ways to keep the device at the center of people’s lives while at the same time recognizing the paradigm shift ushered in by wearables.</p>

  <p>James Tapsfield:</p>

  <p>The extraordinary meltdown was caused by an Excel spreadsheet containing lab results reaching its maximum size, and failing to update. Some 15,841 cases between September 25 and October 2 were not uploaded to the government dashboard.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>Alex Hern:</p>

  <p>But while CSV files can be any size, Microsoft Excel files can only be 1,048,576 rows long – or, in older versions which PHE may have still been using, a mere 65,536.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I don’t work with such massive files, I still prefer to keep CSV files in their original formats rather than converting them to Excel files. Likewise, text files stay as TXT plaintext files or, ideally, as Markdown text files.</p>
