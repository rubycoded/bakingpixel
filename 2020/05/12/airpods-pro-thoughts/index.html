If I had to pick one model, I would buy the Pros because the seal and noise cancellation make them usable in situations where I couldn’t use the regular AirPods.

<p>Interesting review. I love my AirPods 2 and I’ve been curious to try the AirPods Pro, especially when I encounter situations that active noise cancelling would have been awesome.</p>

<p>Also, Matt and I had a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kinson7/videos/10158562776991155/">short chat about AirPods</a> a few days back.</p>
