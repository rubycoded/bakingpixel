<meta name="description" content="John Gruber wrote on Apple CEO Tim Cook is calling for Bloomberg to retract its Chinese spy chip story. Read their statement closely — they’re not saying their story is true or that Apple and Tim Cook are wrong. All they say is they spent a year on the story and spoke to 17 sources multiple times. And the bottom half of BuzzFeed’s story is even more damning than the top — no one in the security community has been able to verify anything in Bloomberg’s story. Anything at all. And no other news publication has backed the story. Bloomberg is all alone on this. This is going to be a huge blow to Bloomberg’s credibility." />
