[Appleinsider](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/05/25/rumor-iphone-12-to-integrate-lightning-over-usb-c-port-less-iphone-coming-in-2021):

> A reliable leaker on Monday claimed the upcoming "iPhone 12" will retain Apple's Lightning connector over a USB-C option, adding that next year's flagship is expected to boast a Smart Connector with no ports at all.

I'm keen to understand the disappointment directed at the seeming lack of a USB-C connector in the upcoming iPhone. I don't get it so please enlighten me.

Personally, I don't have any issues with Lightning cables because that's what I have. And my iPhone 11 Pro sits on the wireless charging stand every night. The battery is enough to last a day so I hardly have to charge it unless I'm out and shooting, in which case Lightning cables work just as well.

That said, I didn't think USB-C on the MacBook Pro was a big deal, but I'm enjoying it on my 16" MacBook Pro, though I haven't had to use all four ports at the same time. The most I've used so far was two external drives when I was reorganising my backups, with the third being the power cable.
