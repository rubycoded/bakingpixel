<blockquote>
  <p>Conway called the employee “horrible” and directed listeners to go after him. “Somebody in San Francisco go wake him up and tell him he’s about to get a lot more followers,” she said on air. Immediately, the call was picked up by right-wing personalities and Trump supporters, who began sharing screenshots of the employee’s tweets. Roth is already facing a torrent of abuse and harassment, including multiple death threats, reports Protocol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such attacks happens on Twitter and nothing is done to curb such behaviour. What we are seeing now is probably one of the highest profile organised harassment of a Twitter user. Will it finally push Twitter to send a signal that this is not acceptable usage of the platform.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Short video app Kuaishou and e-commerce giant JD announced today a new partnership as the Chinese tech titans are gearing up for China’s biggest mid-year shopping extravaganza 618 on June 18.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Kuaishou’s closer relationship with JD comes a few months after a hiccup with Taobao Live, the Alibaba-backed livestream major that supports a similar referral feature.</li>
    <li>Livestream e-commerce, on the cusp of its boom, is expected to become a new driver for the upcoming shopping spree 618.</li>
    <li>The festival comes when the country is trying to boost domestic consumption to offset the economic slowdown resulted from the coronavirus outbreak.</li>
    <li>JD shareholder Tencent invested $2 billion in Kuaishou last year in Kuaishou’s $3 billion pre-IPO round, giving Kuaishou a valuation of around $28.6 billion.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>618 is JD’s equivalent of Alibaba’s 11.11 Singles Day. It’ll be interesting to see how this alliance helps to boost JD’s revenue for this upcoming event on 18 June.</p>

<p>I’m also curious what angle JD will approach the live streaming given the brand’s strength as a reputable, verified ecommerce platform. Taobao is an open marketplace so you see many entrepreneurs and small businesses selling on Taobao, and they conduct their live streams as the shop owner. In contrast, JD stores are more brand flagship stores or authorised resellers.</p>

<p>I have no complaints about my 16” MacBookPro’s camera. It is good enough for calls, but definitely lacking for serious video recording.</p>

<p>You can use all the fancy camera filters and effects in FaceTime on iOS but it doesn’t work on the Mac. That’s a bummer when you want to use Animoji in calls.</p>

				<p>BakingPixel is now on Jekyll hosted on GitHub Pages! Since this is now a static site, you should see a massive boost in performance.</p>

<p>We’ve also used this opportunity to refresh the design. The old design we created with WordPress has been around for 7 years, with some minor tweaks over the years. This is the first major facelift and, like our other sites that we reworked, we have added auto dark mode support.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support all these years and we look forward to putting more content out here!</p>

  <p>Bryner is among the many high school students around the country who completed Advanced Placement tests online last week but were unable to submit them at the end. The culprit: image formats.</p>

  <p>A screenshot of the AP testing portal informing a student that they weren’t able to submit their responses.
Screenshot: College Board
For the uninitiated: AP exams require longform answers. Students can either type their response or upload a photo of handwritten work. Students who choose the latter option can do so as a JPG, JPEG, or PNG format according to the College Board’s coronavirus FAQ.</p>

  <p>But the testing portal doesn’t support the default format on iOS devices and some newer Android phones, HEIC files. HEIC files are smaller than JPEGs and other formats, thus allowing you to store a lot more photos on an iPhone. Basically, only Apple (and, more recently, Samsung) use the HEIC format — most other websites and platforms don’t support it. Even popular Silicon Valley-based services, such as Slack, don’t treat HEICs the same way as standard JPEGs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they had tried testing it with the most commonly used devices they would have noticed this bug instead of only discovering it after rollout.</p>

    This new order also states that these platforms need to remove hateful content promoting racism, sexual discrimination, sexual harassment, and aggravated insults within 24 hours of notification.

    Fiddling with the home screen on iOS is just awful. Whenever I sit down and try to clean it up — deleting apps I don’t use, moving apps into some semblance of order — it drives me insane. The 1984 Finder was awesome for rearranging icons, right on day one. Yet we’re 13 years into iOS and rearranging apps is still terrible, because the whole thing is based on a home screen design where there’s just one screen and no third-party apps. The concept worked fine when all you could do was rearrange 12 built-in apps on a single screen. It feels like a prank trying to use it today.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having an option to select multiple apps and delete them all at once like photos would be really useful. Granted we won’t use it all the time but it will reduce so much friction.</p>

<p>Also, look at how we get to choose how what apps we want in the Dock on the Mac. What if we choose what we want on the home screen, let those we don’t want organise themselves based on category into folders, and we just search for them via Spotlight? Or just ask Siri to launch the app.</p>

    It doesn’t work very well in iOS 13, either. Many times, I’ll type the exact text that appears in the app, and it won’t find it. So I mostly just scroll and read. A long time ago, I reverse-engineered the transcript file format for EagleFiler, so that’s how I search older messages. Unlike in Messages, the matches are highlighted, and you can select the text.

<p>That’s what I do as well. Search works so much better on the iPhone. Keying in the same text generally gives me no results on the Mac and what I’m looking for on the iPhone.</p>

<p>In comparison, It’s so easy to search in Telegram and WeChat on macOS.</p>
