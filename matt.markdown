Matt is a tech enthusiast who spent his first paycheque ever on a mobile phone and a prepaid SIM card. Over a decade later, he&#8217;s still throwing all his money at mobile technology, much to the chagrin of his [wife](http://www.feliciously.com).

His journey includes working as an associate editor at [Ubergizmo](http://www.ubergizmo.com), hanging around the IT department, and running a family business.

Aside from here, he also writes about technology, often about Evernote, and doodles on his [personal blog](http://www.chungliwen.com).

He can usually be found sneaking around [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/kinson7), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/chungliwen), [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/chungliwen), and [Google+](http://www.google.com/+matthewliwenchung).
