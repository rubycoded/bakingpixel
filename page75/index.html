<blockquote>
  <p>Students experienced problems such as tablets failing to switch on, tablets spontaneously going into sleep mode, devices looping while performing automatic repairs, system board failures and issues with wi-fi.</p>

  <p>Principal Gleeson said it was “an informed decision” to choose the HP Elite tablet.</p>

  <p>“A year and a half’s worth of research was put into choosing the right device for us.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They cannot blame anyone if they chose the HP Elite Pad after 18 months of research for the right device.</p>

				<p>TechCrunch reports on Apple <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/23/apple-touch-id-patent-application/">filing a patent application for Touch ID</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The patent describes a system that not only siloes data on the Touch ID “enclave” section of the A7 processor, but that also encrypts the fingerprint maps registered on the device to make it that much more difficult for any thieves to even attempt to pull the data off in any kind of usable form. The enclave is a one-way street, too: the system can check new fingerprints against the stored ones, but there’s no way to check or call up the stored fingerprints at all for external examination once they’re registered.</p>

  <p>Waze wants to give us what we really want, which is, quite naturally, driving directions delivered with the gravitas only Hollywood actors can bring. To that end, the social navigation company has partnered up with Universal Pictures to deliver some cross-promotional synergy that’ll have actors in forthcoming films acting as your virtual co-pilot.</p>

<p>If it included Benedict Cumberbatch or Chris Hemsworth it would definitely pique my interest.</p>

  <p>Well-placed sources tell us that the company is gearing up to launch new private messaging features inside its still red-hot photo and video sharing service. It is also experimenting with the idea of group messaging, our source tells us. The new features are likely to find home in the next version of Instagram, which is expected before end of the year.</p>

<p>He sees it as a natural step towards increasing communication between users.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is fundamentally my belief that most applications need a layer of communication — comments and lightweight signals such as Facebook’s likes are part of that layer. And so is messaging.</p>

				<p>This is pretty novel. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, has used his Google+ page to pen a step-by-step guide on how to move from iPhone to Android. It might sound gimmicky, as there are already plenty of guides on how to make the switch out there, but more importantly it will be interesting to see if that guide actually discourages people from making the switch, since it seems slightly complicated for an end-user to me.</p>

<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/app/basic/stream/z12fjzfxvwnws1e3d23vhni5lybzclmaq04">Eric’s Guide: Converting to Android from iPhone</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are the steps I recommend to make this switch. Like the people who moved from PCs to Macs and never switched back, you will switch from iPhone to Android and never switch back as everything will be in the cloud, backed up, and there are so many choices for you. 80% of the world, in the latest surveys, agrees on Android.</p>

				<p>Most of us have had stuff confiscated by TSA agents before in the name of security. While it’s understandable that we don’t want a plane to blow up in the middle of the skies, the fact that folks are also able to build DIY guns based on stuff purchased after passing through security also shows the futility of such practices.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He realized that airport stores sell lithium metal batteries, which, when combined with water, create a chemical reaction with enough heat to explode a bottle of Axe. This is what powers his “Blunderbussiness Class” shotgun, which he demonstrates shooting $1.33 in pocket change through a piece of drywall, as well as his “Fraguccino” thermos grenade. “Right now if I wanted to build something very potent, I would probably go toward lithium,” says Booth.</p>

				<p>A new take on blogging is always intriguing. With established blogging software such as Blogger, WordPress already in the market, not to mention journals such as <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a>, it’ll be interesting if <a href="http://dayre.me/">Dayre</a> manages to merge the key features of those platforms together with the microblogging aspects of Twitter and Instagram.</p>

<p><a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/11/22/dayre-could-be-the-hassle-free-solution-to-long-form-blogging-youre-looking-for/">Dayre could be the hassle-free solution to long-form blogging you’re looking for</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s say you’re already used to posting on Instagram and Twitter every couple of hours in your day. You can replicate the exact same steps in Dayre — except you get 500 characters for each component — much more than what 140 characters or a filtered photo will allow. What the app then does is accumulate these separate moments into a ‘day’ of your life.</p>
