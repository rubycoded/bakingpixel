Are Technica reported on [IMAX’s absurd attempt to censor it](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/06/from-quote-to-retraction-request-imaxs-absurd-attempt-to-censor-ars/).

> On June 16, Ars Technica was contacted by IMAX Corporation. The company said our story required a retraction because it included a brief reference to IMAX—included without IMAX&#8217;s permission. &#8220;Any unauthorized use of our trademark is expressly forbidden,&#8221; IMAX&#8217;s Deputy General Counsel G. Mary Ruby wrote in a letter (PDF).

> The letter is surprising in several ways. First of all, the article isn&#8217;t about IMAX. The single reference to IMAX in the story is a quote from Alex Schwartz, a game designer interviewed by Machkovech. Schwartz predicted that SteamVR could take off with consumers despite the fact that the room-sized system takes up a lot of space. &#8220;It’s like saying, &#8216;I have an IMAX theater in my house,'&#8221; he told Machkovech. &#8220;It’s so much better that we can get away with a cumbersome setup.&#8221; 

Ridiculous.

> IMAX&#8217;s letter is part of a disturbing trend in which some companies believe that owning a trademark actually allows them to control any speech about their product. Too many examples abound already of trademark owners that believe they&#8217;re entitled to control how movies and TV shows portray their brand. IMAX has taken that to the next level here, believing it is entitled to literally silence someone speaking to a journalist because the name of a corporation happened to slip out of his mouth. 

IMAX issued [an apology](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/06/imax-apologizes-to-ars-for-its-trademark-retraction-demand/) but it should never have had to in the first place.
