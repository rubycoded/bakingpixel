The Guardian reported on [Tim Cook warning that the UK surveillance bill could bring &#8216;very dire consequences&#8217;](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/10/surveillance-bill-dire-consequences-apple-tim-cook).

> “You can just look around and see all the data breaches that are going on. These things are becoming more frequent,” Cook told the Daily Telegraph. “They can not only result in privacy breaches but also security issues. We believe very strongly in end-to-end encryption and no back doors. We don’t think people want us to read their messages. We don’t feel we have the right to read their emails.

> “Any back door is a back door for everyone. Everybody wants to crack down on terrorists. Everybody wants to be secure. The question is how. Opening a back door can have very dire consequences.” 

Let&#8217;s hope the authorities finally see the light.
