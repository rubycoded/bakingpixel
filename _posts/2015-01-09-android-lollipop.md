Business Insider reported on [the breakdown of Android version adoption](http://www.businessinsider.my/google-android-lollipop-adoption-is-pitiful-2015-1/).

> Google in November launched Android Lollipop, which it called its largest, most ambitious OS update ever — but no one is using it.
> 
> Less than 0.1% of Android devices currently run Lollipop, according to the company’s most recent numbers.
> 
> The problem is, very few phones are capable of upgrading to Lollipop yet. It’s up to the carriers and phone manufacturers to decide when the update rolls out to various phone models. 

This compared to 63% of devices on iOS 8 and 33% on iOS 7 as of December.
