Whenever John Gruber takes the time to write a [long post](http://daringfireball.net/2013/12/the_year_in_apple_and_technology), it&#8217;s definitely worth a read, especially if it&#8217;s on the topic of Apple.

I think that he pretty much nails it that when it comes to people who want eye-catching headlines, Apple is never going to win.

> It’s a damned if they do, damned if they don’t scenario for Apple. If a three-year-old device doesn’t qualify for an iOS upgrade, one could argue that Apple is excluding it out of spite, to pressure the user to buy a new device just so they can run the latest software. But if Apple does provide an update for a three-year-old phone, and the upgrade proves problematic for some of them, then they’re accused of booby-trapping it, suckering users into upgrading their iPhones to a version of iOS that makes them run worse, so that the users will run out and buy a new iPhone. 

I just want to chime in with one of the major misconceptions that I feel keeps being brought up.

### Apple products are expensive

This is by far the most common complaint. While it might have been true a while back, I feel I&#8217;m actually getting pretty good value here. I&#8217;m going to sidestep the fact that the current MacBook Air starts from $999, which is cheaper than a lot of good Windows notebooks out there. Instead, I&#8217;m going to use the example of my MacBook Pro which I purchased back in 2010. I can&#8217;t recall the exact price, but I paid something in the region of $1,200 for the machine, and I&#8217;ve been using it for about four years now. The only hiccup I&#8217;ve encountered so far has been a faulty cable inside, which Apple Care took care of pretty quickly.

The thing is, after four years, I constantly forget that I&#8217;m using a four year old machine. The battery still holds a reasonable charge; I&#8217;ve updated it to Mavericks 10.9.1 and don&#8217;t feel that it&#8217;s sluggish at all. So aside from a few minor features like AirPlay mirroring and faster speeds, I don&#8217;t feel that I need to rush to upgrade to the latest MacBook. If I need a performance bump, I just need to purchase an $80 SSD and it&#8217;ll feel like a brand new machine.

On the other hand, my Windows desktops are all on life support, either through failing drivers and crappy hardware quirks here and there.

Planned obsolescence? As I mentioned, my MacBook Pro is going strong. My family members are still rocking the iPhone 4 without any issues. Sure, it&#8217;s not as fast as the iPhone 5S, but it works fine. Try using a 3-year old Android phone.

> The whole “planned obsolescence” thing — started by New York Times economics columnist Catherine Rampell, but promulgated by Mims himself after the ball got rolling — was a pile of horseshit. No company in the computer/mobile industry makes products that hold their value longer than Apple’s. Used two-year-old iPhone 4S’s can be sold for $300; three-year-old iPhone 4’s still sell for $200 or more. What other companies make cell phones that retain any value at all after two years? 

Is Apple right all the time? Hardly, but let&#8217;s be fair here and give credit where credit is due.
