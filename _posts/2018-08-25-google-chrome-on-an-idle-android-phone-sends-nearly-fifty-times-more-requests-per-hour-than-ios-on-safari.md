Digital Content Next reported that [Google Chrome on an idle Android phone sends nearly fifty times more requests per hour than iOS on Safari](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2018/08/21/google-data-collection-research/).

>   * A dormant, stationary Android phone (with the Chrome browser active in the background) communicated location information to Google 340 times during a 24-hour period, or at an average of 14 data communications per hour. In fact, location information constituted 35 percent of all the data samples sent to Google.</p> 
>   * For comparisonâ€™s sake, a similar experiment found that on an iOS device with Safari but not Chrome, Google could not collect any appreciable data unless a user was interacting with the device. Moreover, an idle Android phone running the Chrome browser sends back to Google nearly fifty times as many data requests per hour as an idle iOS phone running Safari.

You&#8217;d think that it is a shocking thing for an idle phone. The real shocker is that people won&#8217;t find it shocking coming from Google and Android.

This is just one of the unseen reasons not to use Android that most consumer would not be aware of.
