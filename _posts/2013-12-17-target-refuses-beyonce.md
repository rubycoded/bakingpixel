Digital Trends reports that [Target is refusing to sell Beyoncé&#8217;s self-titled album because it was first released digitally](http://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/target-severs-ties-beyonce-digital-first-album-release/).

> Releasing a statement about the company’s disinterest in the new album, Target spokesperson Erica Julkowski said “At Target, we focus on offering our guests a wide assortment of physical CDs, and when a new album is available digitally before it is available physically, it impacts demand and sales projections.” 
> 
> Julkowski continued “While there are many aspects that contribute to our approach and we have appreciated partnering with Beyoncé in the past, we are primarily focused on offering CDs that will be available in a physical format at the same time as all other formats. At this time, Target will not be carrying Beyoncé’s new self-titled album ‘Beyonce.’“ 

How is this different from when an album is first released on CDs? Consumers can still choose to download digital copies if they have no intention of paying.
