> As a way to convince users to enable tracking across other apps and websites, Facebook is deploying the tactic of telling users that they must enable tracking as part of the App Tracking Transparency framework in iOS 14.5 if they want to help keep Facebook and Instagram “free of charge.”

Are they threatening to charge people if they don't allow Facebook to track them? Please do your friends a favour and remind them to opt out. If you know anyone who might be misled by this, especially the elderly and less tech-savvy, please take the time to help them out.
