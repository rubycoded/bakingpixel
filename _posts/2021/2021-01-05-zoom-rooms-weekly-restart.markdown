[Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205418949-Zoom-Rooms-weekly-system-restart):

> Zoom Rooms weekly system restart functionality will restart your computer weekly with the following conditions:

> * Between the hours of 2:00-4:00am based on local time on PC or Mac
> * When there is no meeting currently in progress in that room

> By default, the Zoom Rooms computer will restart on Saturday, but you can also select a day for the restart. 

Instead of trying to deal with the memory leaks, Zoom decides to just force you to restart your computer weekly.
