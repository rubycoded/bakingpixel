Wired reported on [Comcast renaming a customer SuperBitch Bauer](http://www.wired.com/2015/02/comcast-renames-customer-superbitch-bauer/).

> Yesterday Mary Bauer received her Comcast bill in the mail. But the 63-year-old Chicago area resident says she’s not going to open it. That’s because someone at Comcast switched her name on the bill, addressing it instead to “SuperBitch Bauer.”
> 
> Bauer has been having problems with Comcast for months. As she related her story to Chicago’s WGN television station, she’s had a lot of service and billing issues. Technicians have been dispatched to her place a whopping 39 times, and she recently got into it with telephone support after her bills stopped arriving. 

This comes after Comcast renamed a customer [Asshole Brown](http://bakingpixel.com/2015/01/comcast-asshole/).
