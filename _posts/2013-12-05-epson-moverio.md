Epson has released [the Moverio BT-100, a pair of goggles that brings you immersive video playback and information overlays](http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Moverio/Home.do).

The Moverio connects to an Android device so you get the full Android experience instead of the stripped down operating system used by Google Glass. To make it more enticing, Epson is making the Moverio available now and cheaper than the Glass.
