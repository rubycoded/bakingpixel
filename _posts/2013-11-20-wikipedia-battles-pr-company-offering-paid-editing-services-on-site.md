I totally advocate entrepreneurial efforts, but I don&#8217;t think that trying to undermine the integrity of Wikipedia is the right way to do it.

[Wikipedia Sends Cease-And-Desist Letter to 300-Strong Sockpuppet Army](http://www.businessinsider.com/wikipedia-cease-and-desist-letter-to-wiki-pr-2013-11)

> Wikipedia has been battling the sockpuppet army since 2012, when one editor discovered five editor accounts being used for fluffy, PR-type writing that is not supposed to appear on Wikipedia. More than 250 accounts, allegedly controlled by Wiki-PR, have since been deleted.
> 
> Wiki-PR charges between $500 and $1,000 to have articles written and then $50 a month for ongoing &#8220;page management&#8221; services.
