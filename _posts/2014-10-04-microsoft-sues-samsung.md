Recode reported on [Microsoft&#8217;s lawsuit against Samsung&#8217;s breach of contract](http://recode.net/2014/10/03/microsoft-says-samsung-owes-it-6-9-million-in-contract-dispute/).

> Microsoftâ€™s lawsuit against Samsung was unsealed on Friday, revealing that the software maker believes it is owed $6.9 million in unpaid interest from last year. 

Of course, Samsung would not [intentionally avoid paying](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tax-evasion-bribery-and-pricefixing-how-samsung-became-the-giant-that-ate-korea-8510588.html).

> A lot is at stake in the case, as is made clear by the details unsealed Friday. Microsoft notes in the suit that Samsung paid it $1 billion last year under the patent agreement. 

We already know that Microsoft [earns a lot from Android patents](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/microsoft-earnings-losses/).
