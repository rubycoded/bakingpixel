The Loop reports on [Microsoft’s ad attacking the Google Chromebook](http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/11/27/microsoft-takes-on-google-chromebook-in-this-tin-eared-ad/).

> This ad makes the case that the Chromebook is not a real laptop, that when it is not connected to the internet, it is “pretty much a brick.” I don’t own a Chromebook, and I’m not necessarily a Chromebook fan, but fair is fair. A “brick”? It took me all of 2 minutes reading reviews to dispel this myth. 

Microsoft seems to think that attacking other brands’ products is the best way to promote its own products.
