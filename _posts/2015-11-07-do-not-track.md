Ars Technica reported on [websites being able to continue ignoring “Do Not Track” requests after FCC ruling](http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/11/fcc-wont-force-websites-to-honor-do-not-track-requests/).

> Consumer Watchdog had petitioned the FCC to &#8220;initiate a rulemaking proceeding requiring &#8216;edge providers&#8217; (like Google, Facebook, YouTube, Pandora, Netflix, and LinkedIn) to honor &#8216;Do Not Track&#8217; Requests from consumers.&#8221; The group&#8217;s proposed rule would prevent online services from requiring consumers to consent to tracking in exchange for accessing Web services, preventing online services from sharing personal information of users with third parties when consumers send Do Not Track requests.
> 
> When consumers enable the Do Not Track setting in their browsers, they send an HTTP header in an attempt to opt out of third-party tracking conducted by analytics services, advertising networks, and social platforms. Some companies have committed to honor Do Not Track requests, but they are mostly ignored. 

The solution is to stop using these websites and use ad-blocking tools that also block tracking. Instead of Google, [switch to DuckDuckGo](http://bakingpixel.com/2015/07/duckduckgo-bangs/).
