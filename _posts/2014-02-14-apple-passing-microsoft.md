Benedict Evans reports on how [Apple sold more computers than Windows PC sold globablly in Q4 2013](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/2/12/apple-passes-microsoft).

> This is a pretty good illustration of the scale of mobile: Apple limits itself only to the high end of the mobile market but still sells more units than the whole PC industry. 

It is also significant to note the shift towards mobile computing.
