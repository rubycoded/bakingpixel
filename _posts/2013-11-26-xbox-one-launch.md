Microsoft held several Xbox One launch events around the world. [The Verge reports on the biggest event held in New York City’s Times Square](http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5132732/microsoft-takes-over-times-square-xbox-one-launch-photos).

It seems like Microsoft is still willing to pump in money to generate revenue, [despite losing $2 billion to the Xbox platform](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/microsoft-earnings-losses/).
