This, coupled with the [Galaxy S4 gold edition](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/25/4769086/samsung-counters-iphone-5s-with-a-golden-galaxy-s4), should silence the mocking of the gold iPhone 5s.

[HTC reveals another gold-colored One, this time without the 18-carat finish](http://www.engadget.com/2013/11/25/htc-reveals--another-gold-one/)

> The latest variant does come late to the game, with Apple&#8217;s gold iPhone 5s enjoying huge demand and Samsung launching the Galaxy S 4 gold edition, albeit in limited markets. HTC says the device will be available across Europe with a number of partners.
