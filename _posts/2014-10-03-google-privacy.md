CNN reported on [Erich Schmidt defending Google&#8217;s privacy policies](http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/02/technology/security/google-apple-privacy/)

Tim Cook:

> But at Apple, we believe a great customer experience shouldn&#8217;t come at the expense of your privacy. 

Eric Schmidt:

> &#8220;We have always been the leader in security and encryption,&#8221; Eric Schmidt told CNNMoney. &#8220;Our systems are far more secure and encrypted than anyone else, including Apple. They&#8217;re catching up, which is great.&#8221;

> &#8220;Someone didn&#8217;t brief him correctly on Google&#8217;s policies,&#8221; Schmidt said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate for him.&#8221; 

Unfortunately, someone didn&#8217;t brief Schmidt correctly. My customer experience with Google could have been better if Google respected my privacy. Just look at the ads that tries to look like emails in my Gmail inbox.
