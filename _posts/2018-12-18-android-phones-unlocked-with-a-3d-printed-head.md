Forbes reported that [they broke into a bunch of Android phones with a 3D-printed head](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/12/13/we-broke-into-a-bunch-of-android-phones-with-a-3d-printed-head/#606fcf721330).

> We tested four of the hottest handsets running Google&#8217;s operating systems and Apple&#8217;s iPhone to see how easy it&#8217;d be to break into them. We did it with a 3D-printed head. All of the Androids opened with the fake. Apple&#8217;s phone, however, was impenetrable. 

FaceID is so understated and under-appreciated.
