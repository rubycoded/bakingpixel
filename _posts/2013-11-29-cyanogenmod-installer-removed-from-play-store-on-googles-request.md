Despite the simplification of the process, this could be a reasonable move to protect consumers, as not everybody might fully understand what they&#8217;re getting themselves into. The good news is that you can still sideload it, so there shouldn&#8217;t be a problem for those who still want to use the installer.

> The reasoning given by Google is that the CyanogenMod Installer violates the Google Play Store&#8217;s developer terms by actively encouraging Android users to &#8220;void [the] warranty&#8221; on their devices. As we saw when we took the app for a test drive, the Installer does indeed de-hair the hairy process of unlocking an Android device&#8217;s bootloader and getting an alternate ROM installed; apparently, though, the Installer made things just a little too easy. As our Android expert Ron Amadeo noted, the CyanogenMod Installer is mostly a &#8220;one-way street,&#8221; without a quick way to return the device to its stock stateâ€”it&#8217;s certainly possible, but not with the same level of ease.
