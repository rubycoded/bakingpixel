These photos from the recent [book on Jony Ive](http://www.amazon.com/Jony-Ive-Genius-Greatest-Products/dp/159184617X) are really interesting and provide an insight into his early design ideas.

[Check Out The Earliest Work Of Apple&#8217;s Design Leader Jony Ive](http://www.businessinsider.com/check-out-the-earliest-work-of-apples-design-leader-jony-ive-2013-11?op=1)

> Kahney highlighted this quote from Paul Kunkel in a book about Apple design: &#8220;Unlike most of his generation, Ive did not see design as an occasion to exert his ego or carry out some pres ordained style or theory. Rather, he approached each project in an almost chameleon-like way, adapting himself to the product (rather than the other way around) &#8230; for this reason, Ive&#8217;s early works have no &#8216;signature style.'&#8221;
