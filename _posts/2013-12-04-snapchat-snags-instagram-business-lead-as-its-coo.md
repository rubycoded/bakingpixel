If [turning down](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/why-did-snapchat-turn-down-three-billion-dollars/) the previous acquisition offers of $3 billion (or $4 billion, depending on the source) didn&#8217;t convince you that Snapchat is becoming a force to be reckoned with, this next move will. It wasn&#8217;t too long ago that Emily White [moved from Facebook to Instagram](http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/2/4176492/facebook-exec-emily-white-heads-to-instagram), and now she&#8217;s heading over to Snapchat to be second-in-command to CEO and co-founder Evan Spiegel. Considering that Mark Zuckerberg tried to buy Snapchat recently, it&#8217;s going to sting to have a key person from Instagram (owned by Facebook) make such a move.

White has a lot of experience in the online advertising space, initially at Google, then at Facebook and Instagram, being instrumental in bringing ads to the latter.

Without a doubt, she&#8217;ll help Snapchat continue on it&#8217;s path taking on the mobile messaging scene. It&#8217;ll also be interesting to see if she grows into a high-profile COO like Facebook&#8217;s [Sheryl Sandberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Sandberg).

> “It happened really quickly, but to have an actual COO role in one of many companies that is disrupting the communications arena is one I could not pass up,” she said. “I have always been captivated by the creativity that has gone into the product … and I think that Evan has been looking for someone who can help him grow and scale what is already something that has changed a lot of the way people think about the mobile experience.”

> “Instagram has great leadership in place and this is not me walking away from anything but an A+ management team,” said White. “But I am about to learn a lot about the way communication is happening right now and am excited to help grow it into a big business.” 

The good news is that she seems to have left Instagram on good terms.

> Said Systrom of her departure in a statement: “I cannot thank Emily enough for her contributions to Instagram. She was tasked with getting the first ads products out the door — and she did that beautifully. Instagram is in an even better place today because of her efforts and we thank her.”
