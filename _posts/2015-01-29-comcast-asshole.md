Wired reported on [Comcast renaming a customer Asshole Brown for trying to cancel his subscription](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/comcast-renames-man-asshole-brown-tries-cancel-cable/).

> Consider the case of Ricardo Brown. After Brown’s wife had a disagreement with the cable company recently, Comcast started sending him monthly statements under the name “Asshole Brown.” 

Comcast employees revealed that the company [values sales above customer service](http://bakingpixel.com/2014/07/life-inside-comcast/). Comcast [admitted](http://bakingpixel.com/2014/07/comcast-customer-retention/) that their retention specialists are trained to make it easy for customers to choose to stay instead of leaving the service.

Changing the customer&#8217;s name to a rude name on an official statement is a new low.
