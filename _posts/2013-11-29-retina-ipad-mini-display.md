Cult of Android reports that [the Retina iPad Mini loses out to Nexus 7, Kindle Fire HDX in DisplayMate’s screen comparison](http://www.cultofandroid.com/45984/retina-ipad-mini-comes-distant-third-in-display-shootout-against-nexus-7-kindle-fire-hdx/)

> “The new Google Nexus 7 has a very impressive display that uses the highest performance LCDs with Low Temperature Poly Silicon LTPS,” DisplayMate found. “The very high efficiency LTPS technology allows the new Nexus 7 display to provide a full 100 percent Color Gamut and at the same time produce the brightest Tablet display that we have measured so far in this Shoot-Out series.”
> 
> As for the Kindle Fire HDX, that was the most impressive overall. It’s the first tablet display to use “high technology Quantum Dots,” DisplayMate says, “which produce highly saturated primary colors that are similar to those produced by OLED displays.”
