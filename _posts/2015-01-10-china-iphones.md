Tech in Asia reported on [Apple selling more iPhones in China than the US](https://www.techinasia.com/china-buys-iphones-time-recordsetting-sales-quarter-report/).

> While holiday sales in the US certainly contributed to that number, UBS says China accounts for up to 35 percent of shipments, outstripping Americans for the first time. During the same period last year, China made up 22 percent of all iPhone sales.
> 
> The US share of sales rose from 24 percent to 29 percent year on year. 

We can see why Apple has been making more effort to expand their China market.
