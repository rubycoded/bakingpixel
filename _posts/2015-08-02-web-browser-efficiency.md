BatteryBox reported on [Chrome vs Safari vs Firefox web browser efficiency](http://blog.getbatterybox.com/which-browser-is-the-most-energy-efficient-chrome-vs-safari-vs-firefox/).

> Averaging data from all websites tested, Safari won first place with 6hours 21min of total usage, Firefox second with 5hours 29min of usage, and Chrome last with 5hours 8min of usage.
> 
> Basically, if you simply switch to using Safari instead of Chrome, on average you could get an extra 1 hour of usage from your battery life. It’s actually a pretty good browser, and now has a fair amount of extensions available. 

Sometimes it&#8217;s not about having the latest and greatest features, but what goes on behind the scenes that matters.
