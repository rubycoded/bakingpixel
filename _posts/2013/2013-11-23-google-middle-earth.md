The Business insider reports on [Googleâ€™s interactive map that allows users to explore Middle Earth](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-is-giving-tours-of-middle-earth-2013-11).

> This map lets you click through all the important places where the action takes place (complete with music and a voiceover). You can look at things close-up, in 3D. 

Tolkien fans would love this. It also highlights how powerful of web sites and web browsers have become.
