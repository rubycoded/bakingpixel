Apple Insider reports on the [worldwide ad impression recorded in the third quarter of 2013](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/11/27/apple-widens-lead-over-android-in-worldwide-ad-impression-share-now-twice-as-large).

> According to fresh data from ad buying platform and mobile DSP Adfonic, Apple&#8217;s iOS accounted for 63 percent of all global impressions during quarter three, a three percent boost from the quarter previous. Despite having a vastly larger marketshare, Android dipped six points to finish the three-month period with a 32 percent ad impression share. 

Interestingly, Samsungâ€™s older models account for more impressions than its latest models.

> Broken down by device, Apple&#8217;s iPhone generated a huge 35 percent of all ad impressions, while the iPad followed with a 21 percent share and the iPod touch hit third with six percent. A sprinkling of Samsung products trailed the Apple pack. The Galaxy S3 managed only three percent, the S2 hit two percent and the Galaxy Ace and S3 mini brought one percent each.
