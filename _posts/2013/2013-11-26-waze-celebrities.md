Engadget reports that [Waze is partnering with Universal Pictures to use celebrity voices to give driving directions](http://www.engadget.com/2013/11/23/waze-celebrity-turn-by-turn-navigation/).

> Waze wants to give us what we really want, which is, quite naturally, driving directions delivered with the gravitas only Hollywood actors can bring. To that end, the social navigation company has partnered up with Universal Pictures to deliver some cross-promotional synergy that&#8217;ll have actors in forthcoming films acting as your virtual co-pilot. 

If it included Benedict Cumberbatch or Chris Hemsworth it would definitely pique my interest.
