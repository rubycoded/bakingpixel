Business Insider reports that [Facebook might be adding a sympathise button](http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-might-be-adding-a-sympathize-button-2013-12).

> When you write a Facebook status, you have the option of choosing to share how you&#8217;re feeling from a drop down list of emotions. If you selected a negative emotion like “depressed” from the list, the “like” button under your status would be relabeled “sympathize.” 

How about having both the “like” and “sympathise” button at the same time? Some people might just be giving a thumbs up at your expense.
