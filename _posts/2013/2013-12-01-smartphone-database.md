The Verge reports on the [completion of the US database that blocks activation of stolen phones](http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/27/5153694/stolen-smartphone-database-is-complete-says-ctia).

> Though most smartphones already offer tools to let you locate lost phones, only Apple has managed to offer a feature which satisfies SF and NYC prosecutors&#8217; desire to deter theft. The Activation Lock feature of iOS 7 can not only remotely wipe a phone, but keep it from being reactivated without the owner&#8217;s credentials.
