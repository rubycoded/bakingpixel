It&#8217;s clear that Lavabit is going to be collateral damage in the Snowden case, regardless of the fact whether the email system was as secure as advertised [or not](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/lavabit-not-as-secure-as-previously-thought/).

> Levison was held in contempt of court and fined $5,000 for every day he did not turn over the keys after the FBI installed a monitoring device on his servers. Without the keys in a &#8220;usable electronic format,&#8221; the FBI could not read any of the data it was collecting.

> Levison waited two days, racking up $10,000 in sanctions, then turned over the keys and immediately shut down his company. He&#8217;s appealing the fine now, arguing that requesting a master set of encryption keys was excessive if the FBI only wanted to monitor one user.
