This comes after HTCâ€™s lawsuit wins in the [Netherlands](http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/22/nokia-preliminary-injunction-against-htc-one-mic/), the [United States](http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/02/htc-nokia-radio-patent-dispute/) and the [United Kingdom](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/12/htc-one-ban/).

The patent does not apply on HTC devices alone. Other Android devices that has the Android Beam function will be considered as infringing on the patent as well. It is understood that Google is working to invalidate the patent to prevent bans from being effected on other Android devices.
