Bill Gates blogs about [his experience as the editor of WIRED for their December 2013 issue](http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Personal/How-I-Became-Editor-of-WIRED).

> For me, it was a chance to extend a conversation I’ve been having when I travel to universities and great research companies. How can we harvest additional brainpower to tackle the problems of the poor? What are the problems that are being ignored and need attention? How do we encourage people who are making great progress? The WIRED audience was a great group to continue that dialogue. They’ve already got a bias toward technology and innovation. Could I convince them to channel some of that capacity for the poor? 

He also [shared some of his thoughts](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/bill-gates-wired/) on [WIRED.com](http://www.wired.com/business/2013/11/bill-gates-wired-essay/all/).
