Business Insider reports on [JPMorgan being burned by its Twitter campaign](http://www.businessinsider.com/what-banks-can-learn-from-jpmorgan-twitter-fail-2013-11).

> JPMorgan had a bit of a public relations nightmare Wednesday when the #AskJPM hashtag it designated for its planned Twitter question and answer session was hijacked by a storm of users furious with the bank for its perceived role in the financial crisis of 2008. 

Sean Womack, SVP of Marketing and Production at Touchstorm, points out something that many organisations are guilty of:

> “Twitter is like a party where you can’t just show up and say it’s yours and take over. You don&#8217;t walk in and say ‘Hey, JPMorgan in the house! Ask me a question.’ without first looking at who’s in the room.”
