Line is a major player in the mobile messaging space in Asia and is one of the leading companies to popularize the sales of messaging stickers. While stickers, or emoticons as we used to call them, might sound insignificant, the fact that Line is pulling in over $10 million a month [just from sticker sales](http://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/08/21/japanese-messaging-company-line-makes-over-10-million-per-month-from-selling-stickers/) is something worth taking note of. If the user base continues to grow at this pace, 2014 is going to be a great year for LINE.

> The company has been aiming to hit the milestone before the end of the year, and it’s made it with over a month still to go, as an official announcement confirms. There has been plenty of talk about a multi-billion dollar IPO — with some rumors suggesting it would follow the 300 million user announcement — but Han says the company has no comment on the speculation.
