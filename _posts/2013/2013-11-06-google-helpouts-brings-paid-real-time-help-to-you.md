[Google Announces Live Video Tutorials Called &#8216;Helpouts&#8217;](http://mashable.com/2013/11/05/google-announces-helpouts/)

YouTube already offers plenty of tutorial videos, but [Helpouts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-VFC9AQM1k) takes things one step further and removes another barrier between people. As certain folks and services become more popular on the platform, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if personalized one-on-one Helpouts will be scalable.

> Google on Tuesday announced Helpouts, a new tool that connects users via live video chat with experts who can help them with questions about home improvement, cooking or even medical advice. Helpouts serves as a Google-vetted marketplace where approved companies such as Sephora, One Medical and Rosetta Stone can offer their services to interested parties in real-time over live video.
