The Next Web reports that [Intel and FC Barcelona have announced a partnership to make the latter one of the world’s most technologically advanced football clubs](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/12/12/intel-deal-seeks-elevate-barcelona-worlds-technologically-advanced-football-club/).

> “This is more than a sponsorship to Intel,” says Deborah Conrad, Intel’s Chief Marketing Officer. “The technology we are deploying and the programs we are working on together are designed to elevate FC Barcelona into one of the most technologically advanced soccer clubs in the world, and to launch an ambitious slate of educational initiatives.” 

I like how the logo is inside the jersey. Yes, inside. And it says “Intel Inside.”
