Business Insider reports that [popular finance app Mint is now available on Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8](http://www.businessinsider.com/mint-app-windows-81-and-windows-phone-8-2013-12).

> The biggest difference with this app compared to the Android and iOS alternatives is it takes advantage of a core element within the Windows 8 operating system: Live Tiles, which are app icons that update in real time with information.
