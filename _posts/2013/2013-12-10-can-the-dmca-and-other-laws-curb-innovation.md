Using the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) to prevent users from unlocking mobile phones is downright crazy. Unfortunately, being crazy doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s not backed by the law. Depending on whether you are living in the year 2006 or 2009, unlocking your phone without your carrier&#8217;s permission could be legal, or illegal.

Let&#8217;s not forget that it wasn&#8217;t too long ago that we had the proposed SOPA and PIPA laws, which saw major Internet sites such as Wikipedia [go dark in protest](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16612628). Despite fending off those threats, there are [more laws like it trying to be passed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA#Other_proposed_laws), so be prepared for plenty of &#8220;Washington VS the Internet&#8221; fights.

> Back in 1998, Congress was drafting the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The law — created after heavy lobbying by record labels and Hollywood studios — was supposed to make it harder for people to copy files. One particular element, section 1201, made it illegal to crack open digital locks designed to prevent copying.

> But the language was so broad that phones got swept up too. Mobile-phone companies encrypt the software that locks a phone to a network, so they started claiming that breaking that encryption — unlocking a phone — was illegal under the DMCA.
