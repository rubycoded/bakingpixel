Newegg has won the fight against patent trolls before, but it loses this round. Next up will be the appeal.

[Jury: Newegg infringes Spangenberg patent, must pay $2.3 million](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/jury-newegg-infringes-spangenberg-patent-must-pay-2-3-million/)

> TQP&#8217;s single patent is tied to a failed modem business run by Michael Jones, formerly president of Telequip. The company has acquired more than $45 million in patent licensing fees by getting settlements from a total of 139 companies. TQP argues that the patent covers SSL or TLS combined with the RC4 cipher, a common Internet security system used by retailers like Newegg.
