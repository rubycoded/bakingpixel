[Samsung won by a score of 535 vs Apple&#8217;s 533.](http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/01/jd-power-explains-why-samsung-beat-apple-in-its-latest-tablet-study-price/)

> The power circle chart showed Apple winning handily in four categories, including performance, ease of use, physical design and tablet features. Only one category showed a clear win for Samsung: cost. But most folks were a bit skeptical, considering that the JD Power report only weights cost as 16 percent of the overall score.
> 
> Parsons confirmed the percentage, but said that the differential between the price category scores of the iPad and the score of the Samsung tablets that were included in the survey was large enough to “more than offset” the score in the other four categories. Parsons says that the price category contributed to a full two-point difference between Apple and Samsung.
