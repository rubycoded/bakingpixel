TechCrunch reports on [Google’s location history browser](http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/18/google-location-history/).

> If you carry any Google-filled gear (like, say, an Android phone or tablet), there was a prompt during the initial setup that asked if Google could transmit your location data back to the mothership. This is that data. You know how Google Now can auto-magically figure out where you work and warn you about traffic? This is the data that makes that possible (or at least a good chunk of it.) 

If you are using an Android device and cannot remember if you agreed to send your location data, [check this link](https://maps.google.com/locationhistory) to see if Google is tracking your location. Unfortunately, Google does not have any of my location history so I will appreciate it if you can share your experience. Do you find it awesome or creepy?
