Google unveils [Project Link](http://www.google.com/get/projectlink/) and writes about how the company is [bringing fast, reliable internet access to Uganda](http://google-africa.blogspot.com/2013/11/launching-project-link-new-way-to-bring_20.html)

The project builds fibre-optic networks to places where internet infrastructure access is inadequate or non-existent.

> Project Link goes beyond basic access; it enables local providers to offer new mobile data plans or high-speed Internet for office buildings and universities, and support newer technologies as they come to market. 

This along with Google’s [Project Loon](http://www.google.com/loon/) is part of the company’s aim to increase internet access around the world.
