Apple Insider reports that [Samsung’s #Galaxy11 viral campaign fumbles when Franz Beckenbauer tweets from iPhone](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/12/03/samsungs-galaxy11-viral-ad-fumbles-when-franz-beckenbauer-tweets-from-iphone). The football legend was the manager of Samsung’s Galaxy 11 dream team.

It is not the first time that celebrities who endorse Samsung actually use an iPhone.

John Legere:

> Sending promotional tweets about other products from Apple&#8217;s iOS devices seems to be quite popular. In October, T-Mobile chief executive John Legere intended to use Twitter to direct attention to Samsung Mobile&#8217;s latest Note 3 phablet, but inadvertently did so via his new iPhone 5s. 

David Ferrer:

> Shortly afterward in April, Spanish tennis player David Ferrer tweeted his satisfaction with his #GalaxyS4 and that he was &#8220;configuring S Health on my new #GalaxyS4 to help with training @SamsungMobile,&#8221; all via Twitter from his que contento estoy con mi iPhone. 

Oprah Winfrey:

> Last year, Oprah Winfrey used an iPad to send out tweets endorsing Microsoft&#8217;s Surface, using the hashtag &#8220;#FavoriteThings&#8221; to say she had bought a dozen of them for Christmas gifts.
