Digital Trends reports that [Twitter has updated its Android app to allow users to favourite other users](http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/android-twitter-experiments-new-kind-fav/).

We can add accounts to a [List](https://support.twitter.com/articles/76460-using-twitter-lists). So this feature is not just about making it easy for users to keep track of their favourite tweeters. This is probably a way for Twitter to better understand the kind of tweets you want to keep track of to help improve its algorithm to recommend users for you to follow, and to serve you targeted ads.
