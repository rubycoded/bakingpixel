Business Insider reports that [Facebook’s News Feed algorithm update is hurting social media marketers](http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-screws-social-media-marketers-2013-12).

> When the change went down, lots of people assumed it would be terrible news for publishers that write a lot about &#8220;memes&#8221; and publish other &#8220;viral&#8221; content – publishers like Buzzfeed and Upworthy. Then AllThingsD&#8217;s Mike Isaac reported that the Facebook executive in charge of News Feed, Chris Cox, has a personal distaste for those two sites. It seemed like their doom was imminent. 

However, that was not the case.

> A week or so after Facebook made its changes, one social media marketing agency, Ignite, analyzed 689 posts from 21 brand pages. Ignite found that in just one week, the number of people who saw posts from those brands declined by 44% on average, &#8220;with some pages seeing declines as high as 88%.&#8221; 

Seems like Facebook doesn’t want companies to look for social media marketers to promote their brands on Facebook. Instead, they want businesses to use Facebook ads and pay to promote their posts.

Social media marketers will not be going out of business. They just need to include the cost of Facebook ads and post promotion in their services.
