WSJ.com writes an editorial about [Judge Denise Cote and her friend Michael Bromwich, who she appointed as an external monitor to review antitrust at Apple](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304355104579236261045331876).

> Then, shortly before Thanksgiving and out of the blue, Judge Cote proposed to amend her injunction to grant Mr. Bromwich even greater powers than he already claimed and also to make monthly briefings to her on what he findsâ€”without Apple present. She denied any previous ex parte contact, but Apple&#8217;s lawyers say Mr. Bromwich told them that he doesn&#8217;t need to wait for the January deadline because Judge Cote privately instructed him during the interview process for the position to get off to a &#8220;fast start.&#8221; 

Bromwich is alleged to be inexperienced in antitrust law.

> While he has great political connections, Mr. Bromwich has no experience in antitrust law. The greenhorn is billing Apple at an $1,100 hourly rate and he was forced to hire the law firm Fried Frank to make up for his lack of expertise, at $1,025 a hour. He racked up $138,432.40 in charges for his first two weeks. A spokesman for Mr. Bromwich&#8217;s firm, the Bromwich Group, declined to comment on matters currently before the court.
