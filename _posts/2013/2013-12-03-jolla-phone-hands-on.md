Vlad Savov writes on The Verge about [his experience with the Jolla phone](http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/29/5156446/jolla-smartphone-hands-on-preview).

> All the effort of adapting to Jolla might be worth it if the device offered some unique advantage over others on the smartphone market, but it doesn&#8217;t. The only standout quality it has is the goodwill of old Nokia loyalists and those who like to support grassroots projects. Unfortunately, there just isn&#8217;t a very good smartphone here, and that&#8217;s what you need if you intend to compete with behemoths like Google, whose Nexus 5 is a startlingly good value at 70 euros less.

Alas, not being an actual Android device, it lacks access to the Google Play Store, so you&#8217;re left to fend for yourself with the limited Yandex and Jolla app stores and the downloadable Amazon Appstore. You can sideload app APKs if you wish, but that&#8217;d require that you understand what the process involves and where to find the requisite software. It&#8217;s rough going. 

The product is still rough on the edges, but it has a passionate team working on it. There is potential for Jolla to become a good alternative to Apple and Android smartphones. But at the moment, most consumers would probably go for similarly priced phones that has better features. I can’t see people going for this phone unless they want to support the Jolla team.
