As an owner of the LG WCP-300 wireless charger myself, which I use with my Nexus 4, I must say that I love wireless charging. It&#8217;s a feature that is very underrated.

[The Nexus Wireless Charger (2013)](http://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-wireless-charger-2013)

> The charger itself is stylish enough to keep out when you&#8217;re not actually charging something, though the glossy face (with the Nexus logo subtly peeking through) does attract fingerprints like nobody&#8217;s business. And as an added bonus, it works through the official Nexus cases as well. 

I do disagree with the final sentence of the review, though. As the review itself mentioned, and many people have noticed, the original Nexus wireless orb charger was [horrible](http://www.androidcentral.com/i-hate-nexus-4-wireless-charger), so the &#8220;Nexus&#8221; brand itself doesn&#8217;t mean that a product is good.

> And it&#8217;s way better than the much-maligned Nexus 4 Wireless Charger. You can get Qi-compatible chargers for cheaper, we suppose. But this one says Nexus. So you know it&#8217;s good.
