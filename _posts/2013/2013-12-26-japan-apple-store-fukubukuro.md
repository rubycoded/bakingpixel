Apple Insider reports on [Apple’s annual “lucky bag” sale in Japan](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/12/24/briefly-japanese-apple-stores-likely-to-kick-off-lucky-bag-sales-on-jan-2).

> As it has done in years past, Apple Stores in Japan will likely start 2014 with sales of _Fukubukuro_, roughly translated to &#8220;lucky bags,&#8221; in celebration of the Japanese new year. Apple retail locations across the country are scheduled to open at 8 a.m. local time on Jan. 2, some two hours earlier than usual, strongly hinting at an as yet unannounced sales event, reports Mac Otakara. 

So what is a _Fukubukuro_?

> In practice, retailers participating in the custom bundle various goods in a bag, which is then sold for a preset price. The contents of each bag can vary, but customers never know exactly what is inside until the package is opened after purchase. If tallied up separately, the products are usually worth more than the package sales price, thereby offering consumers a discount, albeit sight-unseen.
