David Sleight writes on A List Apart[about the exquisitely-designed articles](http://alistapart.com/column/he-aint-snowfalling-hes-my-brother) such as the [“Snow Fall” article ran by the _New York Times_ last year](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek).

This is something designers need to really consider, especially in today’s age of increasingly short attention span. Web pages only have split seconds to hook readers.

Certain pages can afford to invest the time and effort to build gorgeous designs, such as [Apple’s product pages](http://www.apple.com/ipad-air/). But certain types of article do not appeal to as wide an audience and it would be a waste to expend such resources.
