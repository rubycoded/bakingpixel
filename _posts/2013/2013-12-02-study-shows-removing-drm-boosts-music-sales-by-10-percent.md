When DRM was first introduced to curb music piracy, and apparently &#8220;save&#8221; the music industry, it probably has done nothing reduce the value that people get from legitimately purchased music.

[What Piracy? Removing DRM Boosts Music Sales by 10 Percent](http://torrentfreak.com/what-piracy-removing-drm-boosts-music-sales-by-10-percent-131130/)

> DRM was once praised as the ultimate tool to prevent music piracy, but new research shows that the opposite is true. Comparing album sales of four major labels before and after the removal of DRM reveals that digital music revenue increases by 10% when restrictions are removed.

The findings suggest that dropping technical restrictions can benefit both artists and the major labels.
