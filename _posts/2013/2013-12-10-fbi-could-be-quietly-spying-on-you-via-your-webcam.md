Whenver your webcam is active, you&#8217;ll see an indicator light, right? Wrong. According to Marcus Thomas, former assistant director of the FBI’s Operational Technology Division in Quantico, the FBI has been able to use emails with malicious links to send malware to their targets.

Once the malware has been deployed, the FBI have the abilty to turn on the target&#8217;s webcam without the indicator light coming on. If you think that the government is only using these techniques in order to monitor terrorists, it would be less worrying. The issue is that by now we all know that the government is pretty keen on spying on a lot more than just purported terrorists, and have used questionable methods that forced all the big players in tech to [voice out against it](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/12/large-tech-companies-seek-government-surveillance-reform/).

How would you feel if you knew that the FBI have been quietly watching you through your webcam for a long time?
