TechWeekEurope reports that Fujitsu has launched [a laptop that scans the palm to authenticate its user](http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/fujitsu-laptop-palm-vein-authentication-133022).

> “Vein authentication” uses image recognition and optical technology to scan the normally invisible vein pattern of the palm, back of the hand and fingers. It works by radiating the hand with near-infrared rays. The deoxidised haemoglobin in the palm veins absorbs these rays, thereby reducing the reflection rate and causing them to appear as a black pattern. This vein pattern is then verified against a pre-registered pattern to authenticate the individual. 

So the next time you see people holding their palm at their laptop, know that they are not asking their laptops to talk to the hand.
