[Apple announced a second Apple factory in the US, in Mesa, Arizona.](http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/124873-apple-confirms-next-us-factory-set-for-arizona-to-create-2000-jobs)

> The purpose of the factory hasn&#8217;t been named specifically by Apple, though GT Advanced says it has entered &#8220;into a multi-year supply agreement with Apple Inc. to provide sapphire material.&#8221; Sapphire is used abundantly in Apple products, including the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and camera lens in the iPhone 5S. This gels nicely with the word about &#8220;components&#8221; Apple gave us. 

Any chance of sapphire replacing gorilla glass in future iOS devices?
