The issue of government spying has been in the spotlight ever since Edward Snowden&#8217;s exposé. Now several major tech companies are banding together at [reformgovernmentsurveillance.com](http://reformgovernmentsurveillance.com) to call for the reform of government surveillance. We&#8217;re talking about heavy hitters, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, AOL, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Yahoo.

The principles that they&#8217;re calling for include:

  * Limiting Governments’ Authority to Collect Users’ Information
  * Oversight and Accountability
  * Transparency About Government Demands
  * Respecting the Free Flow of Information
  * Avoiding Conflicts Among Governments

There isn&#8217;t any promise that the government will listen and implement any recommendations from these companies, but they have a much larger voice than the average privacy advocate on the street, so hopefully their collective voice (and clout) will count for something.
