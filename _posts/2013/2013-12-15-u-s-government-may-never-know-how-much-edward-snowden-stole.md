Considering how much the NSA is currently spying, it&#8217;s a litle ironic that it wasn&#8217;t able to track Edward Snowden tightly enough when he was working for them to fully understand the amount of data taken by him.

It&#8217;s been said that Snowden passed his entire trove of data to a small group of journalists, and you can be sure those journalists are in the crosshairs of governments around the world, as we&#8217;ve [already seen](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/18/glenn-greenwald-guardian-partner-detained-heathrow) before this.

[Officials Say U.S. May Never Know Extent of Snowden’s Leaks](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/us/officials-say-us-may-never-know-extent-of-snowdens-leaks.html)

> Investigators remain in the dark about the extent of the data breach partly because the N.S.A. facility in Hawaii where Mr. Snowden worked — unlike other N.S.A. facilities — was not equipped with up-to-date software that allows the spy agency to monitor which corners of its vast computer landscape its employees are navigating at any given time.
> 
> Six months since the investigation began, officials said Mr. Snowden had further covered his tracks by logging into classified systems using the passwords of other security agency employees, as well as by hacking firewalls installed to limit access to certain parts of the system.
