9To5Mac reports that [Apple has stripped its homepage and replaced it with a tribute to Nelson Mandela](http://9to5mac.com/2013/12/06/apple-celebrates-life-of-nelson-mandela-on-its-homepage/).

Only a few others have been honoured this way: Gregory Hines, George Harrison, Rosa Parks, Jerry York and Steve Jobs.

Tim Cook and Phil Schiller also tweeted their thoughts:

    Amazing human being. Champion of freedom and human dignity. He set an example for all of the world. RIP Nelson Mandela. We miss you already.
