The Guardian reports on [Occupy Wall Street activists buying $15 million of Americans’ personal medical debt](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/12/occupy-wall-street-activists-15m-personal-debt).

> Rolling Jubilee, set up by Occupy’s Strike Debt group following the street protests that swept the world in 2011, launched on 15 November 2012. The group purchases personal debt cheaply from banks before “abolishing” it, freeing individuals from their bills.
> 
> By purchasing the debt at knockdown prices the group has managed to free $14,734,569.87 of personal debt, mainly medical debt, spending only $400,000. 

The group says that this was done to educate the public about the debt industry.

> “Our purpose in doing this, aside from helping some people along the way – there’s certainly many, many people who are very thankful that their debts are abolished – our primary purpose was to spread information about the workings of this secondary debt market.”
