I can&#8217;t even count the number of times that I&#8217;ve opened an app that I want to use to do something quick, only to immediately be nagged by the pop up prompting for my feedback. There are even times when I try to put a star rating and add in some comments, but most of the time I find it troublesome, and I&#8217;m not the only with who feels that way.

Daring Fireball&#8217;s John Gruber has [his solution](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/12/05/eff-your-review), though I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s something that app developers won&#8217;t like.

Instapaper founder Marco Arment has also [chimed in](http://www.marco.org/2013/12/14/rate-this-app) on this issue.

I&#8217;m personally hoping that Apple will revamp the app review mechanism and offer something that isn&#8217;t so jarring to the user.

> But in not recommending the modal prompt, this still leaves the problem open. How do developers solicit reviews from users without bothering them? In reality, they canâ€™t. This is the Internet and its denizens want what they want the way they want it without any hindrance. To them, review reminders are the pop-up ads of the mobile era, a problem in need of a solution no one has yet to provide. Sure, we hate having to take the one second is requires to dismiss a dialog box, but in all the blog posts whining about this issue, no one has suggested any real ways in which developers can fix it.
