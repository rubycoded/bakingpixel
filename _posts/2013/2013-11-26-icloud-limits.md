[iCloud: My Photo Stream and iCloud Photo Sharing limits](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4858)

> There is no limit to the number of photos you can upload to My Photo Stream over time, but iCloud limits the number of photos that can be uploaded within a given hour, day, or month to prevent unintended or excessive use. 

Seems like Apple is gradually increasing the bandwidth as they scale their iCloud infrastructure.
