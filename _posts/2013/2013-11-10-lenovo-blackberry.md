The Globe and Mail reports on [the Canadian government&#8217;s rejection of Lenovo&#8217;s plan to acquire BlackBerry](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/asian-pacific-business/lenovo-considered-a-bid-for-blackberry-but-ottawa-wouldnt-accept-chinese-takeover/article15256976/).

> Beijing-based computer manufacturer Lenovo Group Ltd. actively considered a bid for BlackBerry Ltd., but the Canadian government told the smartphone company it would not accept a Chinese takeover because of national security concerns, according to sources familiar with the situation.
> 
> Ottawa made it clear in high-level discussions with BlackBerry that it would not approve a Chinese company buying a company deeply tied into Canadaâ€™s telecom infrastructure, sources said. The government made its position known over the last one to two months. Because Ottawa made it clear such a transaction would not fly, it never formally received a proposal from BlackBerry that envisioned Lenovo acquiring a stake, sources said. 

It was perhaps a blessing in disguise for Lenovo.
