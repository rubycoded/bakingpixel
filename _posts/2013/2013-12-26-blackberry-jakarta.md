Tech in Asia writes about [BlackBerry using the code name “Jakarta” for its new phone targeting the Indonesian market](http://www.techinasia.com/blackberry-loves-city-jakarta-codenaming-phone/).

What better way to woo customers from a country than by code-naming a phone after its capital?

The phone better be a hit or BlackBerry will continue to see its market share slip away.
