Detroit Free Press reports that [the Find My Mac app on a stolen MacBook helped police track down two murder suspects](http://www.tuaw.com/2013/12/01/how-find-my-mac-helped-track-down-two-murder-suspects/).

> It had been more than two months since a popular University of Michigan medical student was shot to death, and police seemingly had few leads.
> 
> But on Oct. 3 — 45 miles from where student Paul DeWolf was killed in his Ann Arbor fraternity — a man in Detroit attempted to log onto a computer he’d just purchased through Craigslist. The man didn’t know it, but the Mac laptop had been stolen from DeWolf’s next-door neighbor around the time he was killed.
> 
> That computer had an app that would lead police directly to it, and to the two suspects now charged in DeWolf’s killing.
