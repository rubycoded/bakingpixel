If this move happened a few years ago, BlackBerry&#8217;s BBM could have owned the mobile messaging scene. [Disputes and infighting](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/the-inside-story-of-why-blackberry-is-failing/article14563602/?page=all) prevented that. Targeting developing markets is a good move, though BlackBerry will now have to contend with other messaging giants such as WeChat, Viber, LINE, and several more. LINE in particular just passed the [300 million](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/lines-300-million-users-will-be-a-problem-for-whatsapp/) user mark.

> BlackBerry this morning announced that BBM will be preloaded on some Android smartphones starting in December. The specific models weren&#8217;t named — BlackBerry said &#8220;from leading [original equipment manufacturers]&#8221; — but you&#8217;ll be able to find them in Africa, India, Indonesia, Latin America and the MIddle East.
