The Next Web reports that the [first 5 games for Tencent’s WeChat messaging app has 570 million downloads since August](http://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/11/28/first-5-games-tencents-wechat-messaging-app-hit-570-million-downloads-just-3-months/).

Compare it with LINE to better understand what a feat this is. LINE boasts of more than 30 games but only managed to cross the 200 million game download mark in September.

Earlier, Chinese phone manufacturer Xiaomi sold 150,000 of its latest phone in 10 minutes via WeChat. This underlines the size of China’s mobile market.
