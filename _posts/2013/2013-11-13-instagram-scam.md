Mashable reports on [an Instagram scam tricks users into giving away passwords](http://mashable.com/2013/11/12/instagram-instlike-scam/).

> More than 100,000 Instagram users fell for a bold, effective scam called InstLike, an app that promised free Likes and followers on the photo sharing platform. The app asked users to share their usernames and passwords after downloading, turning them into willing participants of a giant social botnet. 

This wouldnâ€™t have happened if these people focussed on creating great content that brings likes and followers instead of artificially engineering engagements and readership.
