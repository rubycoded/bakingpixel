When the Mac Pro was unveiled, the first thing I thought about was the Power Mac G4 Cube, which in my personal opinion is one of the most beautiful machines ever designed. I think the Museum of Modern Art [agrees with me](http://www.macworld.com/article/1018872/cube.html).

Stephen Hackett has done a brief but good comparison of the technologies and concepts from the Power Mac G4 Cube that were brought over and implemented in the new Mac pro.

If I have any gripes, it would be that I prefer a cube to a cylinder, but I do agree that the Mac Pro&#8217;s design is superior.
