While most are still busy trying to work out same-day shipping, Amazon is already working on half-hour shipping. Amazing.

[Delivery drones are coming: Jeff Bezos promises half-hour shipping with Amazon Prime Air](http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/1/5164340/delivery-drones-are-coming-jeff-bezos-previews-half-hour-shipping)

> Amazon&#8217;s CEO loves a good reveal, and took the opportunity afforded by a 60 Minutes segment to show off his company&#8217;s latest creation: drones that can deliver packages up to five pounds, to your house in less than half an hour. They&#8217;re technically octocopters, as part of a program called &#8220;Amazon Prime Air.&#8221; A drone sits at the end of a conveyer belt, waiting to pick up a package — Bezos says 86 percent of Amazon&#8217;s packages are under five pounds — and can carry them up to ten miles from the fulfillment center.
