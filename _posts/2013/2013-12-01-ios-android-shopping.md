Business Insider reports on [the difference between iOS and Andriod usage for shopping during the holidays](http://www.businessinsider.com/ios-android-shopping-traffic-2013-11).

Adobe tracked visits to over 2000 US retailers’ websites on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday.

> iOS-based devices drove more than $543 million dollars in online sales, with iPad taking a 77 percent share. Android-based devices were responsible for $148 million in online sales, a 4.9 percent share of mobile driven online sales.
> 
> &#8230;iPads drove the vast majority of online sales with $417 million while iPhones were responsible for $126 million. In comparison, Android-based phones generated $106 million, Android-based tablets $42 million in online sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. 

This sums it up.

> However, this is still a jaw-dropping gap in usage between the two platforms. It suggests that the focus on smartphone market share misses a bigger picture about how the platforms are actually used. 

Android owners I’ve come across so far use their devices mainly as glorified video players.
