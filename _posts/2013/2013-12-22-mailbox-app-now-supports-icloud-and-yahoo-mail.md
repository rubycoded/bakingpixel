The good news is that the popular email app Mailbox now supports iCloud and Yahoo Mail, so the app isn’t restricted to Gmail users any longer. There isn’t any indication that support for traditional IMAP email clients is arriving anytime soon, though.

[Mailbox: now for iCloud and Yahoo Mail](http://www.mailboxapp.com/blog/?p=1#mailbox-now-for-icloud-and-yahoo-mail)

> Today we’re thrilled to announce we’ve added Mailbox support for Yahoo, iCloud, me.com, and mac.com email accounts. This is a big step for us — we get more requests for Yahoo and iCloud support than for any other feature. 

The bad news is that support for Yahoo Mail now seems to be [broken](http://www.mailboxapp.com/blog/?p=1#yahoo-support-is-currently-disabled), apparently because Yahoo Mail servers aren’t permitting connections from Mailbox. There isn’t any indication whether this is due to a violation of any of Yahoo’s terms of service, or something related to the [email problems](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/16/tech/web/yahoo-marissa-mayer-email-apology/) that Yahoo has been facing recently.
