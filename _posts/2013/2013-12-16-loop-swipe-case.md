WIRED.com reports on [Loop, a phone case that turns your phone into a credit card](http://www.wired.com/business/2013/12/loop-swipe-phone-to-pay/).

> “Loop’s technology transmits the same magnetic signal wirelessly, emulating a swipe without any change to the merchant’s card reader,” says Loop CEO Will Gravis.
> 
> Like Coin, Loop also comes with a card reader — they call it a “fob” — that plugs into the headphone jack of a smartphone. You swipe your card through the reader to load it into the Loop app. But while the Coin card then uses Bluetooth from the app to transmit data to the separate card device, the Loop app transmits its data straight through the phone case. 

Good idea, but I still favour a solution that is built into the phone rather than a third party one.
