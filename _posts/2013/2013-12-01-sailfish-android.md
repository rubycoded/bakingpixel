Talouselämä Magazine reports that [Sailfish will soon be available for installation on Android devices](http://www.talouselama.fi/nakoislehti/jolla%20ceo%20you%20will%20soon%20be%20able%20turn%20your%20android%20device%20into%20a%20sailfish%20device/a2218386).

> ”There is no such culture in these parts of the world [Finland], but there are people that are installing new operating systems on their devices. In China it is mainstream. About half of the smartphone buyers are upgrading their older or cheaper devices with a better version of Android.”
> 
> “For us it is a possibility to distribute our operating system especially in China. There are websites that already distribute [OS] software and the Chinese customers are doing it ­so we don’t have to teach them. We just have to get Sailfish to those websites – and to make sure that Sailfish will run on different kind of Android devices.” 

A group of ex-Nokia employees [launched the Jolla phone](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/jolla-phone/) earlier this week. It runs on the Sailfish operating system that allows installation of Android apps.
