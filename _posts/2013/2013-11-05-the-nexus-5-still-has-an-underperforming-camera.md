I switched from an iPhone 5 to the Google Nexus 4 nearly a year ago, and by far the only major complaint I had was the camera. It&#8217;s really disappointing to see that Google still hasn&#8217;t fixed it in the Nexus 5.

> Let me just reiterate this point: in the right light, with a steady hand and no moving (or slow-moving) subjects, the camera can take excellent photos. It’s actually really upsetting because it suggests the Nexus 5 is capable of so much more — particularly with macro shots. But, in situations where those three factors are not in play, you will struggle to take a good photo. That means that by the time the lazy autofocus captures your scene, your kid will have stopped making that face, your friends will have thrown back their Jaeger shots, or your pet will no longer be doing whatever hilarious thing it was doing.
