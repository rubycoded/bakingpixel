The Business Insider reports that [Google has to pay $17 million for privacy violation](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-17-million-cookie-settlement-2013-11).

> The case began in 2011 and 2012 when the states discovered tracking of Safari users after visits to Google&#8217;s DoubleClick ad network. Cookies are small files embedded in a computer that contain trace amounts of data based on visitor history. Based on the information they have, cookies offer its clients the ability to make tailored Web pages. In the statement given by Schneiderman, he said that Google directly violated customers privacy who deserve the right to know if someone is following them while they browse the Web. He continued by asserting that Google had violated several privacy laws as well. 

Why target Safari in particular? Does this mean that Google is already tracking your data on Chrome and other browsers?
