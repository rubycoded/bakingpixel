Growing up, Winamp was synonymous with digital music, though it eventually fell behind the pack. If you&#8217;re feeling nostalgic, Ars has an [excellent article](http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/06/winamp-how-greatest-mp3-player-undid-itself/) on Winamp that I highly recommend.

[After 15 Years Of Whipping The Llama’s Ass, Winamp Shuts Down](http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/20/after-15-years-of-whipping-the-llamas-ass-winamp-shuts-down/)

> Winamp is shutting down. The website and all of Winamp’s web services will shut down on December 20 and the desktop player will no longer be available for download.
