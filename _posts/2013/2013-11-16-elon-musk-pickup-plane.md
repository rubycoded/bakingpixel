Autopia reports on [Elon Musk‘s plans for an electric pickup and supersonic jet](http://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/11/elon-musk-pickup-plane/).

> At the New York Times DealBook conference, Musk said there’s an “interesting opportunity to make a supersonic vertical takeoff landing jet,” something he began to envision after the Concorde service ended nearly a decade ago.
> 
> Modeled after the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. — the Ford F-150 — Musk envisions a truck oriented towards consumers rather than fleets. But first, Tesla has to deliver its Model X SUV and its third-generation, mass-market EV in 2017. 

Dream big.
