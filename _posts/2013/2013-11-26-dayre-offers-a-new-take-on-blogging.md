A new take on blogging is always intriguing. With established blogging software such as Blogger, WordPress already in the market, not to mention journals such as [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/), it&#8217;ll be interesting if [Dayre](http://dayre.me/) manages to merge the key features of those platforms together with the microblogging aspects of Twitter and Instagram.

[Dayre could be the hassle-free solution to long-form blogging you’re looking for](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/11/22/dayre-could-be-the-hassle-free-solution-to-long-form-blogging-youre-looking-for/)

> Let’s say you’re already used to posting on Instagram and Twitter every couple of hours in your day. You can replicate the exact same steps in Dayre — except you get 500 characters for each component — much more than what 140 characters or a filtered photo will allow. What the app then does is accumulate these separate moments into a ‘day’ of your life.
