Mashable reports on [Facebookâ€™s Year in Review for your friends](http://mashable.com/2013/12/20/facebook-year-in-review-friends/).

On top of the [Year in Review feature](https://www.facebook.com/yearinreview/) that highlights your top 30 moments, Facebook has introduced the [Year in Review for your friends](https://www.facebook.com/yearinreview/friends/).

> Facebook uses a different algorithm than the one that surfaces News Feed content. The Year in Review is made up exclusively of &#8220;life events and popular posts,&#8221; according to a spokesperson. The &#8220;popular posts&#8221; are determined based on engagement like comments and Likes. 

Another new feature that will soon become a Facebook tradition.
