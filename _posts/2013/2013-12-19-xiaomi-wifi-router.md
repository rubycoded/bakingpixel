Tech in Asia reports that [Xiaomi has announced the beta launch of its wifi router](http://www.techinasia.com/xiaomis-beta-smart-wi-fi-router-costs-15-cents-but-youve-got-to-build-it-yourself/). In this case, beta means you have to build the router yourself. Only 500 units are available at RMB 1 each.

> Xiaomi has gained mass appeal in mainland China for its ability to satisfy users across the broad spectrum of Android, ranging from customization geeks to would-be Apple fans. Of course, the former group would likely be more interested in a build-it-yourself router than the latter. However, Xiaomi might be hoping that once this mundane hunk of silicon and plastic gets in the hands of a few dedicated users, excitement will spread, and so will the router.
