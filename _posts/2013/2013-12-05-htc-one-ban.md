The Verge reports that [HTC One has escaped from a sales ban in the UK, despite being found to infringe on a Nokia patent](http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/3/5171670/judge-says-htc-next-flagship-smartphone-will-arrive-early-next-year).

HTC appealed against a ban on the HTC One and succeeded.

> Arguing against a sales ban, HTC had insisted that an injunction — especially during the holidays — would be &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; for business. 

However, the HTC One Mini did not escape the ban.

> &#8220;In this case the potential harm is more evenly weighted, but importantly the phone was launched much more recently and HTC designed and launched it at a time when HTC knew it was facing a claim for infringement of the patent.&#8221;
