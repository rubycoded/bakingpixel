Adrian Kingsley-Hughes writes on ZDNet how [he has given up on Windows](http://www.zdnet.com/why-ive-all-but-given-up-on-windows-7000023083/).

Unless I want to use full-blown applications such as Microsoft’s Office or Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite, then I can make do with post-PC devices. What’s more, I can usually get things done faster since I&#8217;m not tied to my desk. 

Need a new app? Download it on a smartphone or tablet and leave it to install itself. Mobile apps simply work out of the box without having to worry about compatibility issues. Compare this to when you buy software for a PC. You need to check the minimum requirements needed to run it. While this applies to a certain extent for OS X, the Mac App Store has made the process of installing new apps on OS X just like on iOS.

He also makes a point about the shift towards console gaming. Many people I know cite gaming as an important reason they still use Windows. While consoles have gobbled up a large share of the gaming pie, there are still power gamers who prefer the ability to tweak and custom their games on Windows.

I used to be in the PC gaming camp. But the recent years of being pampered with mobile gaming that simply works, I find myself less patient when it comes fiddling with the game, preferring to just focus on playing the game. Now I find myself more inclined to invest in a PlayStation 4 instead of getting a new PC.

The only times I use Windows nowadays is at work. When large corporations finally shift from using Windows, it could probably be the final nail in the coffin for Windows.
