I personally [advocate net neutrality](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/without-net-neutrality-the-internet-will-never-be-the-same/), though I can understand that the concept will present its own set of [challenges](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/04/net-neutrality-smut-free-internet.html).

This specific report we&#8217;re discussing isn&#8217;t too a big deal, since the porn filter is just turned on by default and users have the option of disabling it, but how many users actually bother to tweak the default settings of their devices?

Maybe next we&#8217;ll see ISPs block websites of its competitors, preventing you from checking out competing packages.

> New customers, says BT in a press release, &#8220;[will] have to make a choice on whether or not to activate the parental controls when setting up their internet connection for the first time,&#8221; adding that &#8220;the option of having the controls implemented is pre-selected.&#8221; You&#8217;ll either have to confirm that you&#8217;re happy with the pre-selected protection level, or actively choose to change the settings, which BT is keen to remind you might expose you to &#8220;content potentially unsuitable for children.&#8221;
