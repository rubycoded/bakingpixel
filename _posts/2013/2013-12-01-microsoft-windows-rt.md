The Guardian reports that [Microsoft is most likely terminating Windows RT](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/26/microsoft-kill-windows-rt-larson-green).

> Larson-Green, who is executive vice-president of Devices and Studios at Microsoft, said that the aim of Windows RT was “our first go at creating that more closed, turnkey experience [that Apple has on the iPad]…” but that Microsoft now has three mobile operating systems: “We have the Windows Phone OS. We have Windows RT and we have full Windows. We&#8217;re not going to have three.” 

It is no secret that Windows RT does not generate value for Microsoft.

> Only Microsoft and Nokia&#8217;s handset division, which is being acquired by Microsoft, make any RT devices. Microsoft had to write down $900m at the end of the June quarter on unsold Surface RT devices.
