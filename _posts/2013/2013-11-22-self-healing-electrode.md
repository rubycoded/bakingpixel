SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory reports that [scientists have invented an electrode that heals itself](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/news/2013-11-17-scientists-invent-self-healing-battery.aspx).

> To make the self-healing coating, scientists deliberately weakened some of the chemical bonds within polymers â€“ long, chain-like molecules with many identical units. The resulting material breaks easily, but the broken ends are chemically drawn to each other and quickly link up again, mimicking the process that allows biological molecules such as DNA to assemble, rearrange and break down. 

This has profound implications should it prove to be a practical solution as such batteries are used by electric cars, cameras, mobile devices and other gadgets. These batteries will be able to go through more recharge cycles and it might mean we no longer need to have to change batteries. Manufacturers could choose to make the batteries not removable, and concentrate on crafting a seamless design.
