SMS, and the associated revenue that carriers derive from it, is facing a serious onslaught from free mobile messaging platforms such as Whatsapp, iMessage, Facebook Messenger, and even Snapchat. Now HDmessaging is offering a white-label solution for carriers to fight back.

> HDmessaging might have one of the most prosaic names in tech, but that doesn’t really matter to the Bay Area startup. Its chief purpose is to provide messaging services to mobile operators so they can fight what is probably a futile fight against WhatsApp and company. HD’s clients include Vodafone, Airtel, Aircel, Singtel, and T-Mobile, among others, accounting for 800 million people worldwide. HD says it processes 1 billion messages a month and is growing 200 percent quarter.
