Many people are still skeptical about Bitcoin at this point, but the [recent high](http://money.cnn.com/2013/11/19/investing/bitcoin-price/) of $900 has certainly increased interest in the cryptocurrency. Now Bitcoin has a new supporter, none other than the maverick Sir Richard Branson himself.

Whether you&#8217;re planning to invest in it; mine it; or ignore it, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to find out more about it.

In his own words:

[Bitcoins in space](http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/bitcoins-in-space)

> I have invested in some bitcoins myself, and find it fascinating how a whole new global currency has been created. For people who can afford to invest a little in bitcoins, itâ€™s worth looking into.
