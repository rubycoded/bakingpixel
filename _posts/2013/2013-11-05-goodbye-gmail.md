[Joe Kissell ditches Gmail.](http://www.macworld.com/article/2059230/why-and-how-im-saying-goodbye-to-gmail.html)

> Some of my complaints are specific to Apple Mail, and I did consider switching email clients. But though I’ve tried many other clients (such as Bloop’s $2 Airmail, the $10 Postbox, and Google’s $10 Sparrow), I’ve never found one that offers all the features I rely on from a combination of Mail and half a dozen third-party plugins. In any case, even a perfect client wouldn’t solve Gmail’s privacy issues, outages, and wacky IMAP implementation. 

This is a very drastic move but I wonder how many others have felt the same way as Kissell.
