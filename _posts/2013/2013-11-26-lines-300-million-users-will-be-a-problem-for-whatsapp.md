WhatsApp had an early start in the mobile messaging game, but it&#8217;s refusal (or delay) to support desktop messaging or stickers might come back to haunt it. If WhatApp doesn&#8217;t take some massive action soon, it runs the risk of being left behind in the wake of newer messaging systems from Asia.

> The company has resolutely stuck to its singular vision of being an over-the-top messaging provider that works across platforms and devices.
