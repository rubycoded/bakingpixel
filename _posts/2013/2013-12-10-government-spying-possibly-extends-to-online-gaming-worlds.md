It seems that spying doesn&#8217;t just live in the real world as governments are now looking to keep tabs on digital worlds too. It could be possible that terrorists or drug dealers are using digital worlds as a meet up point to discuss attacks and potential sales, but if you think about it for the moment, virtual gaming worlds have plenty of [Game Masters](http://www.wowwiki.com/Game_Master), which are staff of the company and are basically Gods within the game. With that in mind, it&#8217;s pretty safe to assume that if you&#8217;re discussing a potential drug deal or terrorist attack, there could be one standing next to your character listening in, without you even knowing.

Let&#8217;s not forget that all your chat logs are probably stored on the server, so if governments did subpoena gaming companies, there would probaby be a large trove of incriminating evidence against the person. So if you&#8217;re intent on breaking the law, an online gaming world probably isn&#8217;t the best place to discuss it.

> The spies have created make-believe characters to snoop and to try to recruit informers, while also collecting data and contents of communications between players, according to the documents, disclosed by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden. Because militants often rely on features common to video games — fake identities, voice and text chats, a way to conduct financial transactions — American and British intelligence agencies worried that they might be operating there, according to the papers.
