[Dave Brasgalla converts Ron Cobb’s “Semiotic Standard” iconography into iOS 7 icons.](http://design.iconfactory.com/ios-7-and-alien/)

> The iOS 7 versions of the symbols keep both their strength and their characteristic flavour. It makes me smile to think that 35-year-old designs can suddenly feel current and even trendy again. It’s tempting to say that Cobb was ahead of his time with his Semiotic Standard, but I think the larger point here is simply that good design is timeless. 

I concur.
