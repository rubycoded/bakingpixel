Did Intel really have an opportunity to own the tablet market with its very own IPAD? Proabably not, but the article is definitely worth a read.

[INTEL’S MISSED “OPPORTUNITY”](http://stratechery.com/2013/intels-missed-opportunity/)

> In short, it’s not that Intel missed on the opportunity to build a tablet. It’s that they never had a chance. The iPad – the Apple one – is successful for many more reasons than its form factor. The touch interface, the OS, the ecosystem, the industrial design, the retail stores, the brand among consumers – all of these played significant roles, and Intel had none of them. There was no opportunity missed, because there never was an opportunity at all.
