Business Insider reports on [the correlation between the size of the world&#8217;s internet population and Google revenues](http://www.businessinsider.com/this-chart-shows-why-google-gives-away-one-of-its-most-valuable-assets-away-for-free-2013-12).

We all known Google depends on its search ads to generate revenue. Now Asymco has a chart to show you how Google’s ad revenue is related to the number of people using the internet.

No wonder Google wants to bring internet to areas with limited or no internet access. Don’t get me wrong. I applaud Google for its efforts to increase internet penetration. But we should keep in mind that it is not without benefit to Google.
