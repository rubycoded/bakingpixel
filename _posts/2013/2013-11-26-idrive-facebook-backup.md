IDrive launches a new feature to [back up your Facebook photos and media, including those that you were tagged in](http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/idrive-launches-facebook-backup-so-you-never-lose-the-photos-and-videos-you-were-tagged-in).

> The service is now available to all IDrive users (including those on the free 5GB plan) and once all the data from Facebook is backed up, users can access their images and videos from any web browser and the company’s iOS app. An Android app, the company tells me, is “coming soon” and all the data is automatically encrypted with what IDrive calls “an NSA-proof private key option.” 

In case someone decides to block you on Facebook, you can still access the photos you were tagged in.
