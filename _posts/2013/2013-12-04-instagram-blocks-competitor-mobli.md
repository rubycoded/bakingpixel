Mobli, which is similar to Instagram, got on everybody&#8217;s radar thanks to its [interesting partnership](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/instagram-rival-mobli-to-be-pushed-to-millions-of-phones/) with Latin America&#8217;s largest wireless carrier, America Movil. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with America Movil, it&#8217;s controlled by billionaire [Carlos Slim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Slim), who regularly trades places with Bill Gates as the richest person in the world.

With about 5 million active users and the America Movil partnership, Instagram might begin to view the app as a threat, which explains why it cut Mobli off from the Instagram API. Before this, Mobli users were able to easily share their content from Instagram to their feeds. Such a move shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise to anyone, as we&#8217;ve previously seen [Facebook cut Vine (owned by Twitter) off from its API](http://marketingland.com/facebook-tries-to-explain-why-it-cut-vines-others-api-access-31804). Twitter has also [cut Instagram off](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/07/26/unable-to-find-friends-on-instagram-twitter-just-revoked-the-apps-api-access/) from its API too.

The API access that was revoked by Facebook and Twitter are all related to finding friends, which could be viewed as a way to lure users off the platform. While the current issue between Mobli and Instagram isn&#8217;t related to finding your friends, it could still be viewed as a tool to lure users away. So Instagram&#8217;s response isn&#8217;t surprising.

[In Instagram&#8217;s own words](http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/03/instagram-blocks-competitor-mobli-from-its-api/)

> Instagram&#8217;s API guidelines make it clear that an application that replicates or attempts to replace the essential user experience violates our terms of use. We have a team dedicated to reviewing apps and enforcing our policies. 

It&#8217;s also worth noting that Mobli is no saint either, as the company has [previously run a campaign](http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/mobli-mylastinstagram-contest/) with the specific goal of having Instagram users move to it&#8217;s platform, along with monetary incentives.
