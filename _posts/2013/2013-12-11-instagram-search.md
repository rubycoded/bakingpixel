Joe Weisenthal writes on Business Insider about his use of [Instagram to conduct real-time search](http://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-search-2013-12).

> Instagram isn&#8217;t perfect, but for the most part you don&#8217;t get re-posts (though re-gramming is a thing on a small scale) and you can fairly quickly establish whether a person&#8217;s photo makes sense in the context of their previous images. Whereas on Twitter lots of people are news curators, on Instagram people mostly all do the same thing: post what they see right in front of their eyes at that time.

And you can&#8217;t search by location (though there are third party search engines that do this). And sometimes you get a lot of people Instagramming a shot of their TV covering news.

News on Instagram is crowd-sourcing of news. Many more pairs of eyes than news agencies can deploy, covering the news at numerous angles.
