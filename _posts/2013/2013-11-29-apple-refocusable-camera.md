Apple Insider reports that Apple has been awarded [a patent for a refocusable camera to be used with a portable device](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/11/26/apple-patents-lytro-like-refocusable-camera-for-iphone).

> Apple&#8217;s U.S. Patent No. 8,593,564 for a &#8220;Digital camera including refocusable imaging mode adaptor,&#8221; describes a method in which a user can take a picture at a certain resolution and refocus the resulting image after the fact. Also noted in the patent is the inclusion of such a system in portable devices, like an iPhone. 

The way Apple’s refocusable camera works is different from Lytro’s light-field camera.

> Unlike Lytro, Apple&#8217;s design employs a movable adaptor situated between the lens element and the imaging sensor. The adaptor holds the microlens array, meaning the camera can operate in two separate modes: high-resolution non-refocusable and low-resolution refocuasable. Lytro&#8217;s microlens component can also be moved closer and farther from the sensor, but cannot be completely removed from the light path.
