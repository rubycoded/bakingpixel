Politicker writes about [Michael Bloomberg’s secret to success](http://politicker.com/2013/11/mayor-bloomberg-bluntness-made-me-rich/).

> “I’ve always said to my kids, ‘You have to like what you see in the mirror and you shouldn’t worry about what other people say,” said Mr. Bloomberg, returning to a favorite topic during an appearance this morning on his weekly WOR radio show with John Gambling
> 
> “Yes, you have to be nice and polite and there’s a common sense and a sensitivity. You don’t insult people and that sort of thing. But you’ve gotta do what you think is right … And in the end, I’ve always believed that is a formula for success,” he continued. “People say, ‘Oh, you know, you’re wealthy now, you have the luxury of saying things that you want to say.’ Um, how do you think I got wealthy? I really believe that.” 

Steve Jobs springs to mind as someone who succeeded thinking the same way.
