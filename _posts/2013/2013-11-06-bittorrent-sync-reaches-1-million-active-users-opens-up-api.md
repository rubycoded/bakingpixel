[Sync, BitTorrent’s Server-Less Dropbox Competitor, Hits 1M Active Users, Now Available As An API](http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/05/sync-bittorrents-server-less-dropbox-competitor-hits-1m-active-users-releases-api/)

With more attention being paid to privacy now that the NSA&#8217;s snooping has been made public, it might be an opportunity for a decentralized file sync platform to pounce on. With the [announcement](http://blog.bittorrent.com/2013/11/05/bittorrent-sync-beta-api-now-available-to-developers/) of the Sync API, the battle for your files continues.

> Sync, a file synchronization service from P2P platform BitTorrent that works as a kind of server-less Dropbox, has picked up some good traction since launching earlier this year, with 1 million active users archiving and synchronizing some 30 petabytes of data on the service to-date (up from 8 petabytes in July). Now BitTorrent is hoping to turn up the volume on that usage: today it’s releasing its first Sync API, which will let developers incorporate the service into their own apps as a way for users to access and share data.
