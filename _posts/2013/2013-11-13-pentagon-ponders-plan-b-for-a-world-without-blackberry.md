Sean Gallagher reports on Ars Technica how the Pentagon [plans to ends its reliance on BlackBerry](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/11/pentagon-ponders-plan-b-for-world-minus-blackberry/).

> And as the DOD moves forward with its Mobile Agenda—an effort to largely move from desktop computers to mobile devices—its technology leaders are looking farther afield to make the transition. “This multi-vendor, device-agnostic approach minimizes the impact of [a] single vendor to our current operations,” Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Damien Pickart told Government Executive.

> In other words, BlackBerry is now expendable. 

Once businesses start to move away from BlackBerry, if they haven’t already done so, BlackBerry will be in bigger trouble.
