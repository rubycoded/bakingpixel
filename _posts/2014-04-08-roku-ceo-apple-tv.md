CNET reports on [claims by Roku CEO Anthony Wood that Apple TV is a money-loser](http://www.cnet.com/news/roku-ceo-apple-tv-is-a-money-loser/).

> Apple TV is essentially an accessory for the iPad. They lose money, which is unusual for Apple,&#8221; he said Thursday, speaking at the Recode conference here. &#8220;If you&#8217;re losing money, why would you want to sell more. 

The CNET reporter failed to notice the flaw in Wood’s assertion. The Apple TV was estimated to [cost $64 to build back in 2010](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9189541/_Margin_challenged_Apple_TV_costs_64_to_build). I’m sure costs would have gone down in the past few years. Given that the Apple TV sells at $99, how is that making a loss?

Also, it is an incredible lack of insight to miss the true value of a content providing device. You need to consider profits generated from the content served by the device. [Just ask Amazon.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/10/12/amazon-makes-no-hardware-margins-on-the-kindle/)

Oh, speaking of Amazon, Roku has [bigger problems to deal with](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CX5P8FC/) than the profits from Apple TV.
