9to5Mac reported on [Apple being on track to hit $1 trillion in total revenue from iOS by the middle of this year](https://9to5mac.com/2017/01/11/apple-1-trillion-in-revenue-from-ios/).

> Last year, some analysts made the unlikely claim that Alphabet or Amazon might beat Apple to be the first trillion-dollar company. Asymco’s Horace Dediu, however, is out today with a new report predicting that Apple will cross the $1 trillion mark this year in terms of revenue generated by iOS, pushing it closer to a $1 trillion market cap.
