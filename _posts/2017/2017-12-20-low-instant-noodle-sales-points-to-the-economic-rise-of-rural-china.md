Business Insider reported that [low instant noodle sales points to the economic rise of rural China](http://www.businessinsider.com/fewer-rural-migrants-moving-to-chinas-cities-2017-12).

>   * China is selling 8 billion fewer packets of instant noodles than it was in 2013.
>   * Fewer local migrants from rural China are moving to cities, which is affecting sales.
>   * Instead, workers are staying in rural areas of China where annual incomes are rising at a faster rate than in cities.

Fair points but I would say that a bigger factor is the increasing awareness of proper nutrition and diet. People here are very health conscious and particular about the food they eat. Between ordering food delivery and grabbing an instant noodles, the former is deemed a healthier choice.
