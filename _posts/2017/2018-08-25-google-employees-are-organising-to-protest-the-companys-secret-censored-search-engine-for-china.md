BuzzFeed News reported that [Google employees are organising to protest the company’s secret, censored search engine for China](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/google-dragonfly-maven-employee-protest-demands).

> Google employees are demanding greater transparency from their employer and confronting management with their ethical concerns about a project named Dragonfly, a controversial censored search app for the Chinese market. 

Instead of looking at this from their perspective and trying to shove their version of ethics on others, perhaps they should pause and think whether people living in China would prefer to have a censored Google search or not having Google search at all.
