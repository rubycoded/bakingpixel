E27 reported that [Alipay and WeChat Pay could be affected by PBOC’s QR code standards](https://e27.co/alipay-wechat-pay-affected-pbocs-qr-code-standards-20171228/).

> Safety issues have emerged over barcode payments, particularly over fixed codes typically seen at restaurant counters. These are sometimes swapped by criminals who intercept payments. Setups that create a new code for each transaction are more secure. 

Alipay and WeChat Pay QR codes stickers are more common at convenience stores and smaller businesses. Many restaurants and stores have switched to new POS systems that uses a handheld to scan the customer&#8217;s QR code, such as the one seen in the article&#8217;s featured photo.
