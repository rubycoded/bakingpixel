> Year-over-year unit sale changes, from Apple’s data summary:
> 
>   * iPhone up to 78.3 million from 74.8 million.
>   * iPad down to 13.1 million from 16.1 million.
>   * Mac up slightly, to 5.4 million from 5.3 million.
>   * “Services” are up significantly, percentage-wise, to $7.2 billion in revenue, from $6.1 billion a year ago.
> 
> iPhone, Mac, and services are strong. iPad sales aren’t a disaster, but continue to slide. The year-over-year revenue numbers are telling (Q1 2017 / Q1 2016, in billions):
> 
>   * iPhone: $54.4 / $51.6
>   * iPad: $5.5 / $7.1
>   * Mac: $7.2 / $6.7
>   * Services: $7.2 / 6.1
> 
> A year ago, iPad revenue was greater than that from Mac and services. Now, iPad has fallen behind both. 

Record quarters revenue.
