TechNode reported that [WeChat launched new shopping function for shopping on JD.com with just a few clicks](https://technode.com/2018/06/14/wechat-jd-shopping/).

> WeChat has launched a new shopping function that lets people shop on JD.com with just a few taps. Now simply by entering consumer product related keywords into the search box at the top of the WeChat homepage or the search function in the “Discover” tab, top search results popping up are product pages JD.com. 

Not surprising. JD is facing stiff competition from Tmall and Pinduoduo.

Great to be able to do this within the WeChat app. I enjoy using the Shenzhen Metro and Bus micro apps within WeChat because I don&#8217;t need to download an app for these services. And they seamlessly work with WeChat Pay. Very low friction and highly practical.
