> After giving it a few hours of play, I can see why AoV was so popular overseas. It’s basically a mobile repackaging of League of Legends — which makes sense, since Tencent owns the company behind that game — meaning that online players select from an almost absurd number of heroes and then face off in a 5v5 format on a three-“lane” battlefield, each team attempting to destroy the other’s turrets and base. 

It is not just because it&#8217;s a mobile version of LoL, the game is a success in China because gameplay is so simple that the game has such a high penetration among all age groups and has a strong female gamer base. It&#8217;s not surprising that 9 out of 10 people you randomly approach would have the game on their phone.

It is very common to walk into cafes or restaurants and see groups of friends teaming up.
