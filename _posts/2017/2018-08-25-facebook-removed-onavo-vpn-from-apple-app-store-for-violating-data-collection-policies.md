Mac Rumors reported that [Facebook removed Onavo VPN from App Store after Apple says it violates data collection policies](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/22/facebook-removing-onavo-from-ios-app-store/).

> Onavo, a free VPN, promised to &#8220;keep you and your data safe when you browse and share information on the web,&#8221; but the app&#8217;s real purpose was tracking user activity across multiple different apps to learn insights about how Facebook customers use third-party apps.
> 
> Whenever a person using Onavo opens up an app or website, traffic is redirected to Facebook&#8217;s servers, which log the action in a database to allow Facebook to draw conclusions about app usage from aggregated data. 

If you use Onavo, all your traffic, including those unrelated to your Facebook usage, would be monitored and logged by Facebook. Know of anyone who used this app?

Are you using Onavo? Were you convinced to use the app because it promised a protection for your data?
