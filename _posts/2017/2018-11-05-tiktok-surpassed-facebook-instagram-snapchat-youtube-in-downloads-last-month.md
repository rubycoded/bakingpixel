TechCrunch reported that [TikTok surpassed Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat & YouTube in downloads last month](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/02/tiktok-surpassed-facebook-instagram-snapchat-youtube-in-downloads-last-month/).

> According to data from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower, TikTokâ€™s installs were higher than those of Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube in the U.S. last month.
> 
> It surpassed the four other apps in terms of daily downloads on September 29, with 29.7 percent the downloads from this cohort of apps, the firm says. 

It&#8217;s unsurprising given it&#8217;s meteoric rise in China early this year. It is an addictive platform that does very well to maximise user interaction while minimising effort needed to generate content.
