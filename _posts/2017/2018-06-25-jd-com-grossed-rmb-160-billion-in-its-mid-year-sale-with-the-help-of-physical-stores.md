TechNode reported that [JD.com grossed RMB 160 billion in its mid-year sale](https://technode.com/2018/06/19/jd-sales-618-2018/).

> China’s e-commerce platform JD.com reached RMB 159.2 billion in sales during its annual 618 Shopping Festival, which occurred between June 1 and June 18.
> 
> The company said transactions were up 37% compared with the same period last year, and more than 90% of the orders from JD’s self-operated stores achieved same-day or next-day delivery, thanks to automated devices. 

Good deals coupled with intensive marketing before 618. That&#8217;s what got me ready for a shopping spree on 618. Half price for many daily necessities and on top of that you get a 10% rebate for every RMB 200 or RMB 300 spent depending on the product category. No brainer to stock up on half a year&#8217;s supply to last me till Single&#8217;s Day.

Tmall and Taobao had promotions during this period too. It&#8217;ll be interesting to compare how Alibaba fared.
