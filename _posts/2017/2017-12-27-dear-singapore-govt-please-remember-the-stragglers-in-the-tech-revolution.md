That is the crux of the problem. Are there stragglers in China too? It&#8217;s a definite yes. The big difference is how willing people are to help one another in China. Strangers will gladly show you how to operate the apps, not to mention trained staff. They even help others to utilise the apps to make use of vouchers or claim promotions through Alipay or WeChat Pay.

It is not the speed of change. It is how people adapt to change.
