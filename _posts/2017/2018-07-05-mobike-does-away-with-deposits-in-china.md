Christopher Udemans reported for TechNode that [Mobike has removed deposits for all users in China](https://technode.com/2018/07/05/mobike-deposits/).

> Deposit-free rides will now be standard across the country. Existing users can apply to have their deposits refunded. According to a Mobike representative, if a warning appears in the app when you try to use the platform after being refunded, you will need to update the app. If it is up to date, the server is giving an old message, and it will work nonetheless. 

Great news. This would definitely help drive adoption. Users who have paid deposits for other services are less likely to pay deposit for another service.

> Mobike has also announced bike rental integration into the Meituan platform, a new fleet of e-bikes to extend transportation range for its users, and a program to recycle components from retired bicycles. 

An alliance to compete against Didi and ofo.
