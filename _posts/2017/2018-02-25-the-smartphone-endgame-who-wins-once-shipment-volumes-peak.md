> For decades, market research firms have been confidently asserting that the &#8220;winners&#8221; in PCs, tablets, smartphones and other consumer electronics are not firms that are profitable or even sustainable, but merely those shipping the largest volumes at any given time. This has enabled them to crown a successive line of failed players, then rapidly move on to a new &#8220;winner,&#8221; often within the same year.

How do you feel about your life now? Feel like a &#8220;winner,&#8221; coasting on your past performance headlines and dusty employee of the year plaques?

I would say it is fair to pursue market share in the first few years but work to translate that into decent profit. But it is not always that easy. Once consumers are used to seeing the brand as a cheap option, they would be not be that likely to switch to a high end model of that same brand.

Let&#8217;s say you have a Toyota Vios. Would you choose to upgrade to a high end Toyota model or would you swap for an Audi, BMW, Mercedes or even a Lamborghini or Ferrari, assuming that all costs involved in that upgrade are equal?

The costs of brand image and marketing do bring in value, both tangible and intangible. Instead of trying to capture more market share through making a loss or breaking even, selling premium models with decent margins result in profits that can be used to build up a better brand reputation.

Market share will increase while there is still a market for new phone users, but that is on the decline and new markets start to decrease. It doesn&#8217;t help that there will be competitors entering the market to fight for their own market share in a saturated market.

This reminds me of the old adage about winning the battle and losing the war.
