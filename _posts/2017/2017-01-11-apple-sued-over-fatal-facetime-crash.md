BBC News reported on [Apple being sued over fatal &#8216;FaceTime crash&#8217;](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38496174).

> The lawsuit alleges that the firm should have introduced a feature that disabled use of the video-chat application while driving. 

Does that mean drink-driving offenders should blame the alcohol breweries?
