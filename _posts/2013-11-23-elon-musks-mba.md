[The American Physical Society interviewed Elon Musk.](http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201311/profiles.cfm)

> But even if someone has no intention of ultimately being a physicist, I still believe that the training of physics is excellent. So as they’re going through their academic career I would recommend studying physics as a good base and then a broad range of engineering courses and then some degree of specialization in an engineering field where it fulfills someone’s interest, and then arts and sciences courses, particularly history. And a few business courses are helpful so you at least know the terminology. You can probably do it with one accounting course, [although] I hate accounting. It’s worth it to have some business courses but you don’t need too many. And I wouldn’t recommend an MBA. I’d say no MBA needed. An MBA is a bad idea.
