Computing reported on [Google &#8216;Customer Match&#8217;](http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2428247/google-customer-match-means-your-email-address-is-now-for-sale-to-the-highest-bidder).

> Google is close to rolling out a tool named &#8220;Customer Match&#8221; which, it appears, will combine a logged-in Google account with any email address handed by a customer to a retailer to create lists of addresses to target specific users with marketing material.
> 
> The search giant can sit comfortably with this arrangement, as the lists of emails are anonymised through the service, meaning Google keeps hold of the specific details and the retailer doesn&#8217;t get them, but can use them to blind dump advertising into Google-based sessions in services such as YouTube, Gmail or basic search functions on the Google homepage.

> It appears Customer Match is another response from Google to dwindling display advertising revenue, as companies attempt to find new ways to push adverts to users without depending on simple clicks of randomised ad banners. 

While Apple is pushing for greater privacy by not tracking you, Google goes the opposite way.
