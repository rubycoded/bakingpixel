The National Federation of the Blind commented on [Apple&#8217;s commitment to accessibility](https://nfb.org/blog/vonb-blog/comments-apple-and-nfb-resolution-2014-12).

> Many of these inaccurate assertions have been fueled by a provocative and poorly reported article from the Reuters news service, [linked here only for reference](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/09/us-apple-mobilephone-accessibility-idUSKBN0FE12Q20140709). Reuters has already been forced to correct the article because it reported, inaccurately, that the National Federation of the Blind once brought suit against Apple, Inc. This never happened, although a demand letter was sent regarding the accessibility of iTunes and iTunes U, and the Massachusetts Attorney General opened an investigation. Those actions resulted in a voluntary agreement with Apple that was a significant step in getting us the accessibility we experience today. 

Aside from misreporting, Christina Farr also wrote with bias against Apple:

> Still, advocates of the disabled want the problem solved by the company at the center of the app world — Apple. Rival Google Inc, whose Android operating system drives more phones than Apple, is also under pressure, but as the creator of the modern smartphone and a long-time champion for the blind, Apple is feeling the most heat. 

She then went on to selectively quote Tim Cook:

> Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in a 2013 speech at Auburn University described people with disabilities “in a struggle to have their human dignity acknowledged.” He said, “They’re frequently left in the shadows of technological advancements that are a source of empowerment and attainment for others.” 

Compare that with the full quote from Cook:

> “People with disabilities often find themselves in a struggle to have their human dignity acknowledged, they frequently are left in the shadows of technological advancements that are a source of empowerment and attainment for others, _but Apple’s engineers push back against this unacceptable reality, they go to extraordinary lengths to make our products accessible to people with various disabilities from blindness and deafness to various muscular disorders._” 

Shameful reporting. Unfortunately, there are people who take what they read as the truth simply because it came from Reuters.
