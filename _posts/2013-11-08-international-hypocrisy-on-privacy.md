With the U.S., and its NSA in particular, increasingly in the spotlight over ignoring privacy issues, many companies and individuals are beginning to look to other countries for alternatives. Germany has always been an option, though it&#8217;s best to know the differences of each country before diving in.

> The fact remains that Germany has built up a solid reputation as a vanguard for its citizens’ privacy. It has some of the harshest data protection rules in the world and was the first to go after Google for picking up Wi-Fi data while collecting imagery for its Street View project. Less well known is that the fine was lowered [after Google shared the data with the government](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/germanys-complicated-relationship-with-google-street-view/).
