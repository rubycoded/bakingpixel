9to5Mac reports on [how Google use over 40,000 Macs](http://9to5mac.com/2013/11/27/how-google-manages-over-40000-macs-without-much-help-from-apple/).

> While Google mentioned during the presentation that it supports four desktop OS platforms (OS X, Windows, Linux, and Chrome OS) internally, it also said these days employees that want to use a platform other than Mac OS X “have to make a business case” to do so. 

Mac OS X is the best operating system I have ever worked with. I can understand Google’s love for OS X.
