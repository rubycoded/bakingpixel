Apple Insider takes a look at [the estimates for Appleâ€™s revenue as a result of its deail with China Mobile](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/12/03/imminent-iphone-launch-on-china-mobile-could-add-10b-per-year-in-revenue-for-apple).

> A deal with China Mobile is hotly anticipated by investors because the carrier has 755 million subscribers, making it by far the largest wireless provider in the world. Of those, 170 million are high-speed data customers. 

The estimates for 17 million iPhones sold is a conservative one. Even at that figure, Apple will be generating $10 billion in revenue.
