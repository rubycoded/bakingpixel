Cell phone roaming charges are always exorbitant, but roaming charges for data have always been insanely overpriced. It&#8217;s not uncommon to hear of data roaming charges that cost [thousands of dollars](http://isource.com/2013/08/22/att-roaming-nightmare/). T-Mobile recently introduced unlimited free data roaming in many countries as part of its &#8220;Uncarrier&#8221; marketing and now Three UK is also offering something similar.

With its [Feel at Home](http://www.three.co.uk/Discover/Phones/Feel_At_Home) service, users will be able to use their local UK allowances in the U.S. So if you&#8217;ve got an unlimited data plan in the UK, that plan will function in the U.S. too, as long as you stick to AT&T and T-Mobile.

With such moves by T-Mobile and Three UK, hopefully the rest of the carriers around the world will slowly begin to offer similar plans targeted at travelers. Until then, T-Mobile and Three UK will be receiving plenty of plaudits.
