AppleInsider reported that [the new Samsung ad attacks iPhone X download speed, ignores performance benchmarks](https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/07/17/new-samsung-ad-attacks-iphone-x-download-speed-ignores-performance-benchmarks).

> Regardless, the ad clearly doesn&#8217;t step into other, arguably more crucial, areas of phone performance where our tests had iPhone X in a clear lead. Looking at the Geekbench results, iPhone X completely destroys the S9+, especially in single core performance. The iPhone came in with single- and multi-core scores of 4,243 and 10,433, respectively, while the S9+ managed scores of 2,007 and 8,307.
> 
> Graphics-wise, iPhone X still outpaced the S9+. The S9+ scored 14,308, very close to, but not topping, iPhone&#8217;s 15,177. In all our testing, there were a couple tests where the S9+ won out, but by-and-large the iPhone X was the more powerful device.
> 
> Next year, Samsung is expected to release the Galaxy S10 and S10+, which will most likely attempt to more evenly compete with Face ID. Currently, the S9 and S9+ use a 2D scanner when validating a face and is much less accurate than Apple&#8217;s 3D infrared TrueDepth camera system. 

Samsung is shooting itself in the foot by going with an ad that draws comparison to the iPhone X.

Comparing download speeds makes a lot of sense since it is something the devices have full control over, not the internet service providers. Not to mention the signal strengths and other factors that might affect download speeds. Because download speed is the key criteria most people look at when choosing which phone to buy.

Sarcasm. In case anyone didn&#8217;t notice that.
