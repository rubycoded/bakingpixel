MacRumors reports on [the iOS domination of mobile device activations in Q4 2013](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/02/12/ios-enterprise-good-technology/).

73% of all enterprise mobile device activations:

> iOS devices accounted for 73 percent of all enterprise mobile device activations and grabbed the top ten spots for most popular devices in the fourth quarter of 2013, reports Good Technology in its Mobility Index Report for Q4 2013. 

50% of enterprise smartphone activations:

> The device usage report from these enterprise users shows that the iPhone made up 54 percent of total device activations, while Android smartphones followed with just over 20 percent. 

91% of enterprise tablet activations:

> The iPad maintains a strong hold on tablet activations, claiming 91.4 percent of enterprise tablet activations in Q4 2013, while Android accounted for the remaining 8.6 percent. The iPad was most popular in Financial Services and in Business and Professional Services, with the two sectors accounting for 60 percent of all Q4 iPad activations. 

And people still say that the iPad is a content consumption device and [has no place in enterprise](http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-makes-fun-of-the-ipad-in-new-windows-8-ad-2013-5).
