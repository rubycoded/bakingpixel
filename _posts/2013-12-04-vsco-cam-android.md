Visual Supply Co (VSCO) has [announced that its smartphone camera app VSCO Cam is coming to Android](http://vsco.co/blog/vsco-cam-for-android-available-tomorrow).

Finally. VSCO Cam is my favourite app for editing my iPhone photos. Android photographers will be delighted to finally be able to add this awesome app to their arsenal.

Users will also be able to access VSCO Grid, an online gallery for users to showcase their works.
