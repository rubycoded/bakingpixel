TUAW reports on [a chart by Fidlee that demonstrates iOS and Android support for older devices](http://www.tuaw.com/2013/12/03/when-it-comes-to-supporting-older-devices-ios-outshines-android/).

The chart shows that most older Android devices are a few verions of Android behind the latest release.

> Even more jarring is that some Android models, just two years after their initial release, are two major versions of Android behind. Three years out, you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find an Android device that isn&#8217;t three or four major versions of Android behind. 

Apple provides better support for older devices, with the iPhone 4 supporting the latest version despite being in its fourth year after release. The iPhone 3GS was supported into its fifth year after release, up until Appleâ€™s release of iOS 7 earlier this year.

> Things look a whole lot different on the iPhone side of the equation. An iPhone 3GS for example, a device which first launched in June of 2009, was compatible with all iOS updates up until Apple released iOS 7 this past summer. The takeaway is that when you purchase an iPhone, you can be confident that you will be able to take advantage of future iOS features and enhancements many years down the line. The value proposition provided by the iPhone in this aspect is simply unmatched by Android. 

Many Android users complain that Apple forces users of older devices to upgrade their iPhones. This chart proves the contrary. Android users with older devices are the ones who are forced to upgrade to a newer device to be able to enjoy the latest Android version.
