The use of token-based payments is something the banks have been pushing for and something the credit card networks are similarly excited for. 

I have come across ill-informed people trying to scare others about how insecure Apple Pay is, and some have no idea how Apple Pay works and simply claim it isn&#8217;t safe because they think it isn&#8217;t. It pays to find out more before passing judgement.
