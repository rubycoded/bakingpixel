The Verge reported on [Google&#8217;s Doubleclick serving malware](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/19/6537511/google-ad-network-exposed-millions-of-computers-to-malware).

> The first impressions came in late August, and by now millions of computers have likely been exposed to Zemot, although only those with outdated antivirus protection were actually infected. 

That means that millions of computers are on outdated antivirus.

And using an ad-blocker proves to be more effective than having an antivirus.
