WSJ.com reported about [the Apple-IBM partnership](http://online.wsj.com/articles/ibm-apple-want-consumer-apps-catered-to-corporate-1405552056).

> Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook says he does 80% of the work of running the world&#8217;s most valuable company on an iPad.
> 
> &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason why everyone shouldn&#8217;t be like that,&#8221; Mr. Cook said in an interview, explaining why Apple struck a partnership with International Business Machines Corp. IBM to develop applications catered to big businesses, or enterprises. &#8220;Imagine enterprise apps being as simple as the consumer apps that we&#8217;ve all gotten used to. That&#8217;s the way it should be.&#8221; 

As John Gruber [pointed out](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/07/17/cook-ipad-dogfood), this is in stark contrast to Google chairman Eric Schmidt who [admitted to still using a BlackBerry](http://9to5google.com/2013/03/21/google-chairman-eric-schmidt-admits-he-still-hasnt-kicked-the-crack-blackberry-habit/).
