Bloomberg reported on [three of tech’s top CEOs planning to skip President Obama&#8217;s cybersecurity summit](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-11/three-of-tech-s-biggest-ceos-to-skip-obama-cybersecurity-summit).

> Facebook Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, and Google’s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt all were invited but won’t attend the public conference at Stanford University, according to the companies. Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook is planning to be at the event, where Obama is scheduled to give the keynote speech and have a private lunch with a select group of attendees. 

You would think that the CEOs would be actively involved to show their commitment to information security and take an active role in fighting for the privacy rights of their users.
