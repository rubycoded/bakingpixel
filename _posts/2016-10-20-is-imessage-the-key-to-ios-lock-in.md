> Over time, iMessage has become indispensable in my everyday life. If the gadgets I have to carry with me on a daily basis are the bones of my tech existence, iMessage is the connective tissue. It’s quick work chats; it’s sharing location on the way to a meeting or dinner; it’s sending a GIF of a hug to a friend who is having a bad day; it’s keeping in touch with mom; it’s getting a series of poop emojis from my niece on her iPod Touch.

This might be the case in the West, but in Asia, the alternatives such as Whatsapp, WeChat, and LINE still reign supreme. In Malaysia where I live, Whatsapp is the de facto messaging system everybody uses.

One thing that always has me scratching my head is that why Google can&#8217;t seem to roll out a proper competitor to this. Sure, now we have [Google Allo](https://allo.google.com), but while I hope it works out, I don&#8217;t have much confidence that it&#8217;ll be a success anytime soon.
