TUAW reports that [Target sold a demo iPad unit to on Black Friday and instead of going to Target for an exchange, she contacted a local news agency](http://www.tuaw.com/2013/12/03/target-accidentally-sells-demo-ipad-unit-new-owner-freaks-out/).

> Not only that, according to the original report, the customer noticed that it was a demo unit after inspecting the sticker on the bottom, but instead of simply returning it to Target she decided to call a local news agency. You know, for justice. 

This is a simple case of an inventory mistake by Target. This woman chose to blow up the incident and insisted that the iPad belonged to a woman in California.

> Crowley made the assumption that this iPad belonged to another real human being. However, she also noted that the label on the box said &#8220;demo.&#8221; 

Media outlets picked up the incident and started spreading sensationalist headlines. CNET’s headline read: [“Woman buys &#8216;new&#8217; iPad Air (full of someone else&#8217;s stuff)”](http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57614346-71/woman-buys-new-ipad-air-full-of-someone-elses-stuff/)

A Google search turned up many news sites that used similar misleading headlines.
