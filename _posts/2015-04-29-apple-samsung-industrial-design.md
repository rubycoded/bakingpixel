It matters to some people, but not everyone will appreciate it. Just like how there are people who can live with thinking that they just need to sweep the dirt under the furniture to consider the room is clean.

This is a great example of how much effort Apple puts in to creating something that they care for. Samsung can copy the design but they can&#8217;t copy the spirit that goes into the design process.
