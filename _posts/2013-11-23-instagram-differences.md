[The differences between Instagram on iOS, Android and Windows Phone.](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/11/instagram-wp-ios-android/?viewall=true)

> Windows Phone has positioned itself as a unique mobile OS with a strikingly different look and navigation features compared to other major platforms. Most apps on Windows Phone look and behave significantly differently than on iOS or Android, and Instagram is no exception. 

The experience seems more disjointed on Windows Phone but I will have to try it myself before I comment more. Still, this is the first release on Windows Phone and it can only get better with future versions.
