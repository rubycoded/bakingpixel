The Next Web reports on [Windows 8 selling 100 million copies less than Windows 7 after 15 months from launch](http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2014/02/13/15-months-windows-8-sold-100-million-fewer-copies-windows-7/#!vIXEm).

> Windows 7 launched on October 22, 2009. In October 2010, Microsoft revealed that it had sold over 240 million Windows 7 licenses in the operating system’s first year, and in January 2011 that number grew to 300 million at the 15-month mark.

> Windows 8 launched on October 26, 2012. In February 2014, Microsoft revealed that it had sold over 200 million Windows 8 licenses in the operating system’s 15 months. No matter how you slice it, that’s not good news for the company. 

John Gruber nailed it with this comment:

He also astutely picked up on how both versions sold in similar quantities in the first six months
