> Five weeks later, on a whim, I figured I’d see if Google Photos had made any tweaks and re-downloaded the app. Instead of my pair of test photos, I saw hundreds of images. They weren’t synced from my phone in that moment, because I always delete photos from my device once they’ve been uploaded. My phone must have been uploading pictures to Google Photos even though I didn’t even have Google Photos on my phone. [&#8230;]

Since making this discovery, I have re-created the issue multiple times in multiple settings on my Galaxy S5.

Several hours later, I received a terse email that said, “The backup was as intended.” If I want to stop it from happening, I was told I&#8217;d have to change settings in Google Play Services. 

Be careful what you&#8217;re getting yourself into with a free app. If you&#8217;re not paying, you&#8217;re the product.
