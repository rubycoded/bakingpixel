> It makes no sense to me why ride-hailing, payments, and messaging would fit together in a single app, but once these things get entrenched, itâ€™s easy to see how they stay entrenched thanks to network effects.

It doesn't make sense until you start using it.

A single app removes the friction of using a standalone app.

Let's say I want to use a ride-hailing app. These are the steps I'll need:

1. Downloading an app
2. Wait for it to install and then launch it
3. Sign in or create an account
4. Verify the account
5. Link a payment method
6. Start using the app

I use WeChat instead of Kakao so I can only speak for WeChat. To use a ride-hailing app within WeChat, I'll need to:

1. Search for the mini-program and launch it
2. Tap to allow the mini-program to log in with your credentials
3. Start using the mini-program
