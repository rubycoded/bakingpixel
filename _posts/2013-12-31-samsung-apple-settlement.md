The Korea Times reports that [Samsung wants to settle the patent dispute](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2013/12/133_148788.html).

> Samsung still prefers to sign a comprehensive “cross-licensing” deal, allowing the world’s biggest smartphone manufacturer to access all Apple’s design-related, some standard-essential and commercial patents; while Apple is asking Samsung to pay over $30 per device for Samsung’s patent violations, which Samsung thinks is “too much,” said another Samsung official who is familiar with the issue. 

Seeing that it is futile to deny infringement, Samsung has decided to license the patents so they can openly copy with no repercussions.
