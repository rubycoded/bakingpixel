Finally. If you&#8217;re still facing this problem, you can deregister your number [here](https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage).

> But with the recently-released web tool, all you need to do is enter the phone number you wish to uncouple from Apple&#8217;s iMessage system. Apple will then send you a confirmation code over SMS â€” type it into the browser window and you&#8217;ll be home free. via [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/9/7183507/apple-tool-deregister-imessage-phone-numbers-released)
