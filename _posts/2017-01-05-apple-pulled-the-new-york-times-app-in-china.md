ReCode reported on [Apple pulling the New York Times app in China](http://www.recode.net/2017/1/4/14170212/apple-pulls-china-nyt-app).

> “For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations,” Apple said in a statement. “As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.”

> The New York Times already has its website blocked by Chinese sensors, but a redesigned iOS app allowed customers to bypass the firewall. The New York Times said in its article on the issue that the app will continue to work for those that have it, but that new users will have to find a way to get the app from another country’s App Store (which typically requires having a foreign credit card). 

You can&#8217;t blame Apple for abiding by local laws. Locals who want access to such information would know how to bypass the firewall. NYT didn&#8217;t have to stick it&#8217;s head in.
