[WeChat](http://www.wechat.com/en/) has announced a partnership to allow users to share personalised sticker from Japan-based [MotionPortrait](http://www.motionportrait.com/en/)â€™s sticker-making app StickerMe.

StickerMe users are able to custom stickers from a selfie. Through this partnership, WeChat users can share their personalised stickers from the StickerMe app directly to their WeChat conversations and Moments.

As part of the launch of this collaboration, MotionPortrait has made a set of Christmas-themed StickerMe templates available exclusively to WeChat users this December.

StickerMe is available free on [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ansutanpu/id602990823) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motionportrait.facestamp).
