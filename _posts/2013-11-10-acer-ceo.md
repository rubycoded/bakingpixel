The New York Times Bits reports on [the resignation of Acer CEO JT Wang](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/acers-chief-resigns-amid-slump-in-pc-sales/).

> Acer is the fourth-largest PC maker in the world, but it has been hit hard by a decline in sales of desktop computers as more consumers and businesses turn to tablets and other devices. The company said Tuesday that its sales in the most recent quarter were 92.15 billion Taiwan dollars, down 12 percent from a year ago. It posted an after-tax loss of 13.12 billion Taiwan dollars, or $446 million, for the quarter. 

Another company that was not able to adapt to the winds of changes fast enough. This resistance to change is perhaps reflected in the article&#8217;s comments section.
