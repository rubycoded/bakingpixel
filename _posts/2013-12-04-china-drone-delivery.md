[Since the demo of Amazon Prime Air](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/12/amazon-prime-air-delivery-drones-to-achieve-half-hour-shipping/), the debate about drone delivery has been raging in the US. Meanwhile, [China is already testing parcel delivery using drones](http://qz.com/120654/china-could-become-the-first-country-to-legalize-parcel-delivery-by-drone/).

Legalisation would merely be a formality since businesses in China are already allowed to use drones as long as they apply for approval to do so.
