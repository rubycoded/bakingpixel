[Laptop Mag compared the two cameras side by side.](http://blog.laptopmag.com/iphone-5s-vs-lumia-1020-camera "iPhone 5s vs Nokia Lumia 1020: Camera Shootout")

> The iPhone 5s conclusively beat the Nokia Lumia 1020 in our photo face-off, taking seven out of 10 rounds–and tying one. Even after updating the Lumia 1020′s camera software, which reduced issues with the blue color cast on many images, colors were still more accurate on the iPhone. Apple’s device also excelled when delivering detail and contrast.
> 
> The advantage that the Lumia 1020 has is that you can recompose your shot after you take it because of the phone’s very high 41-MP resolution. Overall, though, the iPhone 5s snapped better-looking images in a wider range of conditions. 

I would choose the iPhone 5s as my everyday camera simply because of the variety and quality of camera apps available on iOS.
