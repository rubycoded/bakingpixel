iPhone in Canada reported on [BlackBerry and Dell&#8217;s responses to the Apple-IBM partnership](http://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/blackberry-ceo-apple-ibm/).

BlackBerry CEO John Chen:

> I am not afraid of competing when I know I am more nimble. I never think [that] going alone is the right strategy. But we have a value add that no one else can do. 

John Swainson, head of Dell&#8217;s global software business:

> I do not think that we take the Apple-IBM tie-up terribly seriously. I think it just made a good press release.
> 
> I have some trouble understanding how IBM reps are going to really help Apple very much in terms of introducing devices into their accounts. I mean candidly, they werenâ€™t very good at doing it when it was IBM-logoed products, so I do not get how introducing Apple-logoed stuff is going to be much better. 

This reminds me of the famous quote by Steve Ballmer:

> There&#8217;s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance. It&#8217;s a $500 subsidized item. 

Microsoft missed the mobile market under Ballmer&#8217;s watch as CEO. BlackBerry and Dell are struggling in the mobile and PC markets respectively. To be unconcerned by the Apple-IBM push in enterprise won&#8217;t bode well for them.
