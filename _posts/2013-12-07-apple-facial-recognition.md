Apple Insider reports that [Apple has been awarded a patent for facial recognition technology that controls a device such as an iPhone, iPad or Mac](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/12/03/future-iphones-may-unlock-hide-messages-based-on-a-users-face).

> For example, during an incoming phone call, an iPhone may be able to &#8220;sense&#8221; that someone is looking at the device&#8217;s screen. If the person is not an authorized user, the iPhone&#8217;s screen remains off and only a ringtone or vibration alert is provided. If the person is an authorized user, the usual incoming call UI is displayed.
> 
> In another example, an incoming email can be blocked from view unless the authorized user&#8217;s face is detected by the system. This implementation would be helpful for users who choose to display part of the message in the lock screen.
