TechCrunch reports that [Appsfire will cease to be an app discovery service within a week](http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/13/appsfire-exits-the-app-discovery-business-to-focus-on-mobile-advertising-native-ads/). It will focus on mobile ad technologies instead.

> Says CEO Ouriel Ohayon, it’s “something we should have done a while ago.”
> 
> But the company’s data base of App Store data, called “App Genome,” is not going to waste. It will power AppsFire’s ad engine instead. This means AppsFire will not serve ads for those apps already installed on a user’s device. “So what we did with the app was totally useful to what we’ll do now,” Ohayon tells us. “It’s more than useful. It is what we believe will make us unique.” 

Technically, it will still be helping users discover apps through ads.
