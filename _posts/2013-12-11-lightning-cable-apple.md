John Gruber writes on Daring Fireball [about the Lightning adapter](http://daringfireball.net/2013/12/lightning_apple).

If the USB developers keeps to the proposed timeline for the implementation of the reversible USB plug, Apple’s Lightning cable would have already been in the market for four years

> The Lightning adapter epitomizes what makes Apple Apple. To the company’s fans, it provides elegance and convenience — it’s just so much nicer than micro-USB. To the company’s detractors, it exists to sell $29 proprietary adapters and to further enable Apple’s fetish for device thinness. Neither side is wrong.

> _Apple doesn’t give a shit what everyone else is doing._ To some, that’s what makes Apple great. To others, it’s what’s wrong with Apple. One side thinks, _Why in the world should we have to wait until 2016 to have a smaller, reversible plug?_ The other side thinks, _Why in the world would you want a proprietary, non-standard, expensive plug?_ 

The future is now. Guess which camp I belong to.
