The Verge spoke to [more than 100 Comcast employees](http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/28/5936959/comcast-confessions-when-every-call-is-a-sales-call).

One common theme was the importance of retaining customers.

> We locked down the ability for most customer service reps to disconnect accounts. We queue the calls for customers looking to disconnect to a retention team who are authorized to give more deeply discounted products to keep subscribers. 

Upgrade the customer where possible.

> The pay was great and everything else about the job was a nightmare. I remember when a 90-year-old woman called to add phone to her account and my boss told me afterwards, &#8220;She was probably senile… but you should have upgraded her cable. I don’t think you are going to be sitting in this seat for very long.&#8221; 

Sales is more important than customer service.

> I would be frustrated because I would tell them we need customer service training as much as sales training, but it came from Philly [Comcast’s headquarters] so that’s what we had to deal with. [Managers] would listen to the call, even have secret shoppers call in. If we didn’t ask [customers] to get more products we would be spoken to. Eventually, selling became part of tech support and billing.
