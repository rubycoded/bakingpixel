e27 reported on [freelance platform 3Clicks](https://e27.co/freelancing-new-norm-still-faces-massive-problem-20180516/).

What caught my eye is the unfortunate name of the company. This is a textbook example of how not to name a company.

Notice that they are branding it as 3Clicks with a capital C. This makes it less obvious but they can&#8217;t hide the fact that the URL would mostly be typed in lowercase: [www.3clicks.co](http://www.3clicks.co).
