Why iPhone and iPad sales are not the same:

It’s a combination of hardware and a new iOS that piques the interest of millions of users.

These groups would probably not have purchased a traditional computer, but have taken to the iPad for some computer-related tasks, such as Web surfing and email. Of course, there are exceptions, but for the most part, that seems to hold true.

Personally, I have owned the iPad 2 and iPad 3. The only factor that pushed me to upgrade was for the Retina display. Since then, I haven&#8217;t found an incentive to push me to upgrading from the iPad 3. It is good enough and runs the latest iOS and apps. The new form factor of the iPad Air and iPad Air 2 is tempting, but it is not a major factor for me.

For some, the smaller size of the iPad Mini is a compelling reason to make the switch. My girlfriend prefers to use the iPad Mini when she&#8217;s out simply because it is more portable and lighter. But when we are at home, she still picks up the iPad because of the larger screen.

Instead of comparing the iPad with the iPhone, we should compare it with tablet competitors:

> What would concern me is if consumers were buying a competitor’s product instead of the iPad. That doesn’t appear to be happening. Samsung hasn’t been doing great lately and Amazon doesn’t release any numbers, so we don’t know for sure how they’re doing (although all indications are not as well as Apple).

> In fact, when you look at surveys about consumer’s intent to purchase, the iPad leads over the competitors. There seems to be no direct reason, i.e. a trouble with the product, that would tell me there is a problem with the iPad.
