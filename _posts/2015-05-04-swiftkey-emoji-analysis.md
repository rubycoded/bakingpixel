Some of the stuff that they&#8217;ve discovered:

If you&#8217;re using third party iOS keyboards like SwiftKey, you might just want to be sure that you&#8217;re okay with them analysing your typing habits.

For privacy and also performance reasons, I prefer to stick to Apple&#8217;s official iOS keyboard.
