SC Magazine reports that researchers have developed a way to [identify users based on the way they type](http://www.scmagazine.com.au/News/365221,users-ided-through-typing-mouse-movements.aspx).

> A series of 90 minute typing tests carried out on 2000 people at Iowa State University found users could be identified with a half percent margin of error based on the way they hit keys.
> 
> The work has been spun into an application that could continuously authenticate usersÂ and lock accounts if another person jumped on the computer resulting in irregularities being detected.
