It&#8217;s 2014, and the unbundling of mobile apps continues.

> &#8220;The simple story with Swarm is that this is an app that has just four basic screens in it, and it&#8217;s the fastest and easiest way to keep up and meet up with your friends,&#8221; Crowley says. The app benefits from technology enhancements that were impossible in the early days of Foursquare, making checking-in a breeze (Swarm &#8220;is probably what foursquare would have been if it was invented in 2014 instead of 2009,&#8221; Crowley adds), but just as importantly, it removes that mechanic from the main Foursquare app.
