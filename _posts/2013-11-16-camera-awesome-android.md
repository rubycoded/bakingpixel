PetaPixel reports that [SmugMug’s Camera Awesome app is finally available on Android](http://petapixel.com/2013/11/13/camera-awesome-app-finally-arrives-android-devices/).

> For Android fanboys offended that it took 20 more months to bring Camera Awesome to Android than iOS, you might want to give SmugMug a pass on this one.
> 
> Both apps actually went into development at the same time, but the fact that Android is fragmented across so many different devices with varying screen sizes and capabilities caused serious headaches for the design team.
> 
> “It turned out to be so much more difficult than iOS,” CEO Don MacAskill told CNET. “The plethora of devices is a real pain. Earlier versions of Android had some serious issues around memory management, so taking and editing photos was basically the thing you couldn’t do without jumping through all kinds of hoops.” 

The trouble developers face due to Android’s fragmentation.
