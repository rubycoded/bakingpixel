BBC reported on [Safari users winning the right to sue Google over privacy](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32083188).

> The case revolves around a so-called Safari workaround, which allegedly allowed Google to avoid the Safari web browser&#8217;s default privacy setting to place cookies, that gathered data such as surfing habits, social class, race, ethnicity, without users&#8217; knowledge. 

Users prefer Safari because it prevents tracking by default.

> The landmark case potentially opens the door to litigation from the millions of Britons who used Apple computers, iPhones, iPods and iPads during the relevant period, summer 2011 to spring 2012, said Jonathan Hawker who represents the Google Action Group, a not-for-profit company set up to manage claims against the internet giant for breach of privacy. 

Google protests:

> &#8220;Google, a company that makes billions from advertising knowledge, claims that it was unaware that was secretly tracking Apple users for a period of nine months and had argued that no harm was done because the matter was trivial as consumers had not lost out financially.&#8221;
