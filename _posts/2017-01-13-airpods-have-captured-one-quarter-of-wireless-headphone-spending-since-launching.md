MacRumors reported on [AirPods capturing one quarter of wireless headphone spending since launching](http://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/11/airpods-slice-intelligence-data/).

> In the U.S. last month, an estimated 75% of revenue from headphones sold online came from wireless models, up from 50% in December 2015, according to Slice Intelligence. Apple&#8217;s new AirPods led the way, capturing an estimated 26% share of online revenue in the wireless headphone market since launching on December 13.
> 
> AirPods stole the top spot from Beats, which took an estimated 15.4% of online revenue in the wireless headphone market, down from 24.1% between the start of 2015 and December 13. Given it owns Beats, Apple appears to have actually taken nearly 40% of online revenue in the market since launching AirPods. 

Other than hardcore audiophiles, most users would find wireless headphones a more convenient option. With EarPods so commonly used, the trend would favour a shift to increasing AirPods adoption as users switch to wireless headphones.
