Wired reported on [Facebook giving video makers a cut](http://www.wired.com/2015/11/facebook-is-going-to-start-giving-video-makers-a-cut/).

> While Facebook’s video numbers continue to grow, some critics, such as well-known YouTube creator Hank Green, have questioned Facebook’s standard for counting video views (a view is any video seen for 3 seconds or more). YouTube, for its part, counts a “view” as someone watching a video for 30 seconds or more. 

Another big issue is how some Facebook pages are stealing videos and using them to gain a following and to get view counts, often without crediting the creator and disfiguring the videos with text slapped over them. Will Facebook be more active in taking down such videos to protect creators?
