While there is an [ongoing rush](http://gigaom.com/2013/09/25/googles-same-day-delivery-service-launches-for-bay-area-shoppers/) to achieve same-day delivery services, Amazon hasn&#8217;t lost focus that there are also customers who want to be able to receive their packages on a Sunday too.

> “If you’re an Amazon Prime member, you can order a backpack for your child on Friday and be packing it for them Sunday night,” said Amazon VP of worldwide operations Dave Clark, in a statement. “We’re excited that now every day is an Amazon delivery day, and we know our Prime members, who voraciously shop on Amazon, will love the additional convenience they will experience as part of this new service.” 

This deal is also a huge win for USPS as it wasn&#8217;t too long ago that it was trying to end deliveries on Saturday as a means to cut costs.

> Post office officials proposed ending Saturday deliveries as a way to save money, but that idea was shot down by Congress. Geddes says lately the system has been looking for new ways to make money. For instance, it recently announced a pilot program setting up postal windows in Staples outlets in the San Francisco area. Geddes says measures like these are a step in the right direction. But he says they&#8217;re not enough by themselves to solve the huge problems the system faces.
