One of the last things that Apple did during the iPhone 6 and iWatch event was give away a free U2 album to every iTunes users out there &#8211; whether you wanted to or not. Depending on which side of the fence you&#8217;re on, you&#8217;re probably overjoyed at the freebie, or appalled that Apple can just push a music album into your device. If you fall into the latter category, you&#8217;ll be happy to know that Apple has put up a [link to remove the album from your iTunes library](https://buy.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/offerOptOut). This should put an end to the complaining. It won&#8217;t. But it should.
