The Verge reported on [former head of Android and current Xiaomi VP Hugo Barra praising the iPhone 6](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/28/7084041/the-former-head-of-android-calls-iphone-6-the-most-beautiful).

> Using careful language, Barra suggested that Xiaomi phones and software sometimes resemble existing products because the company is young and its designers lack confidence.&#8221;It&#8217;s a fight, but I think we&#8217;re learning and we&#8217;re progressing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you look at the stuff that&#8217;s coming next from us, you&#8217;re going to see some unique new twists.&#8221;
