9to5 Mac reported on [the large reservation orders in China for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus](http://9to5mac.com/2014/10/03/chinese-iphone-6-4-million/).

> Yesterday, Chinese iPhone 6 reservations were stated as 2 million in six hours, a rather stunning statistic. Today, an update from the Chinese media press Tencent now says that reservations have topped 4 million. If all these reservations convert into orders, China alone may beat out the iPhone 6’s launch numbers, which — at the time — were considered to be impressive. 

As John Gruber [pointed out](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/10/03/china-iphone-6), these figures defies critics who [sees only doom and gloom for Apple in China](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/technology/personaltech/glum-sign-for-apple-in-china-smuggled-iphones-go-begging-.html).

> “Stocks of the iPhone 6 are way too high right now,” said one wholesaler of smuggled iPhones in Beijing’s northwestern tech hub Zhongguancun.
> 
> The smugglers’ experience represents the new reality for Apple in China.
> 
> Four years ago, the iPhone 4 was a status symbol, with the black market booming before the product was officially introduced. Today, the iPhone is simply one option among many, as local companies like Xiaomi and Meizu Technology rival Apple in terms of coolness while charging less than half the price. 

And the number [keeps going up](http://sale.jd.com/act/nAqiWgU34frQolt.html).
