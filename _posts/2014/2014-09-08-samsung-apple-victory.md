AppleInsider reported on [Samsung&#8217;s &#8216;rushed,&#8217; &#8216;half-baked&#8217; announcements](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/04/samsungs-rushed-half-baked-announcements-set-apple-up-for-easy-victory-this-fall-analyst-says?utm_source=loopinsight.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Feed%253A+loopinsight%252FKqJb+(The+Loop)&utm_content=FeedBurner).

Analyst Brian White:

> &#8220;In our view, this strategy was ill-advised because we found the event &#8216;half baked&#8217; with no details around the price points, launch dates a bit fuzzy, limited technical specifications, and &#8216;gimmicky&#8217; features,&#8221; White said in his note, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider. &#8220;With the potential threat of this event now out of the way, we believe this just made Apple&#8217;s &#8216;Fab Fall&#8217; launch a lot easier because the company&#8217;s #1 competitor does not appear well prepared to take on Apple&#8217;s new iPhones this fall.&#8221; 

The point of rushing their announcements before [Apple&#8217;s event](http://www.apple.com/live/) is to steal the limelight and put a dent on Apple&#8217;s new products. Either they are ill-prepared or they are waiting for Apple&#8217;s move before they innovate on the features and match the prices.
