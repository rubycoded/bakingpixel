Android Central reported on [the Samsung Gear S](http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gear-s-hands-on).

> So here we are with Samsung&#8217;s sixth — yes, a full half-dozen — smartwatch in a little more than the space of a year. To wit: The Samsung Galaxy Gear, Gear 2, Gear 2 Neo, Gear Fit, Gear Live and, now, the Gear S. That&#8217;s a whole lot of Gear. 

Instead of trying to be first in the market after picking up rumours of an Apple wearable, I believe Samsung would have packed a bigger punch if it took the time to refine their smartwatch before launching it.

They are punishing early adopters and also dissuading potential buyers from getting a smartwatch. With Samsung very likely to release yet another smartwatch in a few months time, would you want to spend your money on it?

I wrote about [Samsung executive David Eun commenting on the Galaxy Gear](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/samsung-defends-galaxy-gear/):

> “What we’re dealing with is small green tomatoes,” he said of the Gear’s first-generation growing pains. “And what we want to do is take care of them and work with them so they become big, red ripe tomatoes. And what you want to be sure of is that you don’t pluck the green tomato too early and you want to make sure that you don’t criticize a small green tomato for not being a big, red ripe tomato.” 

Samsung is doing exactly what he says they shouldn&#8217;t. They are plucking their green tomatoes and pushing them to the consumers.
