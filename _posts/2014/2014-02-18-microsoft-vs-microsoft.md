Ben Thompson writes about [Microsoft’s business model](http://stratechery.com/2014/microsoft-v-microsoft/).

Farhad Manjoo named Apple, Google and Amazon as companies that he recommend relying on because of their business models.

Microsoft’s chief spokesperson Frank X Shaw was annoyed by Microsoft’s omission from the recommendations:

> And with a cross-platform connected ecosystem that spans the workplace to the living room featuring best in class products like Office, Skype and Xbox, we’re a pretty safe bet too. 

Microsoft’s chief of marketing Tami Reller gave a very different insight as to how the company makes its decisions:

> If that wasn’t clear enough, Reller pointed out that changes to Office’s platforms would be a business decision, not one based on customer requests.

> “We come at it from that angle, which is ‘What businesses do we need to drive forward?,’” said Reller. “That’s how we will make the decision [to go cross-platform]. It really ends up being business by business, product by product. There’s no sweeping one decision.” 

Ben concludes:

> So to summarize, Office is not available everywhere, and probably won’t be anytime soon, because Microsoft has a devices business to prop up. Oh, and Microsoft’s business needs are a priority over user needs. Tell me, Frank, how is that a safe bet? 

It might be too late to jump into the device business and the purchase of Nokia is a last-ditch attempt to turn things around. Meanwhile, Microsoft is losing ground in their services as mobile continues to grow rapidly.

Bringing Microsoft Office to iOS might stop the slide long enough for Microsoft to find its feet as a service and device company with its Nokia devices. Time is running out for Microsoft as consumers have already shifted to iOS solutions, Google Drive for iOS, and most recently Apple’s iWork for iOS.
