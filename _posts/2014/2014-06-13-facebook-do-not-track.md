Advertising Age writes about [Facebookâ€™s use of web browsing history for ad targeting](http://adage.com/article/digital/facebook-web-browsing-history-ad-targeting/293656/).

> But what Facebook is now enabling is far more expansive in terms how it uses data for ad targeting. In a move bound to stir up some controversy given the company&#8217;s reach and scale, the social network will not be honoring the do-not-track setting on web browsers. A Facebook spokesman said that&#8217;s &#8220;because currently there is no industry consensus.&#8221; Social-media competitors Twitter and Pinterest do honor the setting. Google and Yahoo do not. 

What is the point of a do-not-track option when you still get tracked by those who have no qualms about trampling over your privacy rights so they can earn more money?
