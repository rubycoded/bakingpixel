ReadWrite reports on [Facebook’s announcement of its new “Trending” feature](http://readwrite.com/2014/01/16/facebooks-new-trending-feature-takes-another-page-out-of-twitters-playbook).

After hashtags and embeddable posts, trending is the latest Twitter feature that Facebook has adopted. This is a step towards Facebook’s goal of becoming more than just a place for friends and family to connect.

Twitter’s success stems from it being a way for people to talk about themselves, _and_ a way for people to find out what is going on in the lives of others. While users have been using Facebook in a similar way, it has been hard for Facebook users to aggregate that information. Hashtag was the first step in allowing users to tag their posts. The new trending feature will help users to find trending news.

I doubt I would be using Facebook much for trending news. Do you think it would be useful for the way you use Facebook? Or will it end up being shunned by users like what happend to hashtagging?

I’m still waiting for a way to search my old Facebook entries instead of having to manually scroll through my timeline.
