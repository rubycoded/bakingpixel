Ars Technica reports on [adware vendors buying over Chrome extensions and then injecting ads and malware into the browsers of existing users](http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/01/malware-vendors-buy-chrome-extensions-to-send-adware-filled-updates/).

Google is aware of the issue, stating that it will be [changing its extension policy](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/12/google-chrome-extensions/) in June this year to allow only single-purpose extensions. So for the time being, either you live with the ads, remove the offending extension or switch to a different browser.
