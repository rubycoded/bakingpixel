Forbes reports that [97% of mobile malware is on Android devices](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2014/03/24/report-97-of-mobile-malware-is-on-android-this-is-the-easy-way-you-stay-safe/).

> If you want to stay safe on Android there’s the solution: stick to buying apps on the Play Store and every one in 1000 apps you buy may have had malware for a brief period. 

I’ll like to hear what pro-Android users have to say. Keep in mind that a large proportion of Android users are probably not tech savvy enough to know how to scan for malware.
