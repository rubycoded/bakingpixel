SamMobile reports on [the implementation of the fingerprint sensor in the Galaxy S5](http://www.sammobile.com/2014/02/17/explained-samsungs-implementation-of-the-fingerprint-sensor-on-the-upcoming-galaxy-s5/).

> The sensor itself works in a swipe manner, which means that you would need to swipe the entire pad of your finger, from base to tip, across the home key to register your fingerprint properly. Also, you would need to keep your finger flat against the home key and swipe at a moderate speed or else it won’t recognise your fingerprint. The fingerprint sensor is sensitive to moisture, as well. So, don’t try to use it with wet fingers because it will, literally, give you an error and tell you to dry your fingers first. 

Whatever happened to all that talk about Apple’s Touch ID being a gimmick?
