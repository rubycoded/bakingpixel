Compare this with Microsoft’s lack of control over PC hardware:

> Now, if you live near a Microsoft store, you can buy a PC on which Microsoft does own the desktop experience: The devices the company sells in its own stores come with a clean installation of Windows, blessedly free of the meddling of those other vendors. Alternatively, you can bring in a PC and have Microsoft clean it up for you, even working with the hardware manufacturer on your behalf to solve problems.

Then, there’s Google’s lack of control over Android:

> Android phones are similarly jacked up with crapware, often installed by not one but two parties: the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the carrier. Oh, boy! Do I want to use Google’s music service or Samsung’s? Or maybe Verizon’s? Man, if only I had bought a case with this phone maybe I’d have a fourth choice. 

So, we have a sad situation where consumers live with the clutter.

> For the majority of Windows and Android users, the user experience comes pre-cluttered with a confusing cacophony of attempts to steal your eyeballs. And, since those two platforms are used by more people than Apple’s, that means most of the people in the world go through their desktop and mobile computing lives like this. 

Apple has the advantage of producing the software _and_ hardware, creating the experience it wants to give its users.

But the all-in-one experience is not going to end there. With iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, that experience will be enhanced with Continuity. If you own a Mac and an iPhone or iPad, you get to enjoy a seamless experience moving between the platforms.
