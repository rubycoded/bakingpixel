9to5 Google reported on [Samsung saying that the screen Gap on the Galaxy Note 4 is a feature](http://9to5google.com/2014/09/30/samsung-says-note-4-screen-gap-manufacturing-issue-is-a-feature-not-a-flaw/).

Android Central reported that [Samsung acknowledged the issue in the Note 4 manual]():

> A small gap appears around the outside of the device case
> 
>   * This gap is a necessary manufacturing feature and some minor rocking or vibration of parts may occur.
>   * Over time, friction between parts may cause this gap to expand slightly.

It is appalling to see Samsung trying to wriggle its way out of a manufacturing issue and actually claim that it is a feature. And while the media blew Bendgate out of proportions, they seem to be turning a blind eye to an actual defect in the Note 4. This also highlights the engineering feat that Apple accomplished in making the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus screens blend so seamlessly into the aluminium back.
