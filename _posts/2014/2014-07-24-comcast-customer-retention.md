John Gruber made a very good point about [Comcast customer retention](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/07/23/comcast-making-it-easy).

Comcast COO Dave Watson:

> I know these Retention calls are tough, and I have tremendous admiration for our Retention professionals, who make it easy for customers to choose to stay with Comcast. 

Gruber:

> That is literally just another way of saying that their job is to make it difficult to leave Comcast. Itâ€™s somehow more obnoxious though, that he phrases it so euphemistically.
