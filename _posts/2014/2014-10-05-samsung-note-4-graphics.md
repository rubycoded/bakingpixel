Apple Insider reported on [the Samsung Galaxy note 4 being outperformed by the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus despite haveing more cores and RAM](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/10/04/samsung-galaxy-note-4-delivers-poor-graphics-performance-vs-apple-iphone-6-plus).

> Samsung&#8217;s own even-higher resolution Note 4 (or equally high resolution Galaxy S5 flagship) both turn in benchmarks far lower than Apple&#8217;s new 6 Plus—and less than half that of last year&#8217;s iPhone 5s. In terms of fps, the latest benchmarks show that Samsung&#8217;s new Exynos-powered Note 4 drops down to 10.5 fps—almost half that of iPhone 6 Plus— in the same test.

> Looking at the fairly decent, low level theoretical scores of the GPUs Samsung uses (combined with much higher clock rates and more RAM), it appears that the company&#8217;s devotion to extremely high resolution numbers is a spec list checkmark (rather than a real feature that benefits users) and is a primary contributing reason for poor real life scores in rendering 3D OpenGL scenes.

> In other words, the chips Samsung is choosing to use could theoretically match Apple&#8217;s latest iPhones if they were not also driving tons of additional pixels that contribute little to no benefit to users. Think of it as a reasonably powerful engine installed into a monster truck with massive wheels it can barely turn. 

Unfortunately, there will always be people who blindly chase specs.
