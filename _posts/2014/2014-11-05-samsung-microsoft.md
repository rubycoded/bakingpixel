Android Central reported on [Samsung refusing to pay Android royalties to Microsoft because the latter was a direct hardware competitor](http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-calls-microsoft-direct-hardware-competitor-refuses-pay-android-license-fee).

We [reported](http://bakingpixel.com/2014/10/microsoft-sues-samsung/) a while about [Microsoft&#8217;s](http://bakingpixel.com/2014/08/microsft-samsung/) action against Samsung.

> Samsung is now stating that since Microsoft owns Nokia&#8217;s devices unit, sharing sensitive data with the company would result in a breach of US antitrust laws. 

If Samsung is so adamant about not breaching antitrust laws, perhaps Samsung should stop using Android. That way it won&#8217;t have to pay licensing fees and won&#8217;t invite charges of collusion.
