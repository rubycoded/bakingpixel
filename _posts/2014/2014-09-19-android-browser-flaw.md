Are Technica reported on [Android Browser flaw bring a “privacy disaster” for half of Android users](http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/09/android-browser-flaw-a-privacy-disaster-for-half-of-android-users/).

> Baloch initially reported the bug to Google, but the company told him that it couldn&#8217;t reproduce the problem and closed his report. Since he wrote his blog post, a Metasploit module has been developed to enable the popular security testing framework to detect the problem, and Metasploit developers have branded the problem a &#8220;privacy disaster.&#8221; Baloch says that Google has subsequently changed its response, agreeing that it can reproduce the problem and saying that it is working on a suitable fix.
