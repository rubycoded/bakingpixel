Microsoft released a statement [on the change in their stance towards privacy](http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2014/03/28/we-re-listening-additional-steps-to-protect-your-privacy.aspx).

> Effective immediately, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property from Microsoft, we will not inspect a customerâ€™s private content ourselves. Instead, we will refer the matter to law enforcement if further action is required. 

Something they should have done from the start.
