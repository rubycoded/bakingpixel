Ben Thompson share more of [his thoughts on the Apple Watch](http://stratechery.com/2014/got-wrong-apple-watch/).

> This makes the Pebble sound a lot like a smartphone circa 2006. The thing is, though, the iPhone was never targeted at 2006-era smartphone users: it was targeted at everyone, and that meant it had to destroy our expectations of what a smartphone was in order to build a new one that happened to look exactly like an iPhone. Similarly, to be the sort of tentpole product Cook promised the Watch would be it must target more than current watch wearers: it must be a product so good that non watch-wearers will put something on their wrists, put up with nightly charging, spend hundreds or thousands of dollars every few years, and all the other sorts of behavior that no one thought any rational phone buyer would tolerate just eight years ago. In other words, it must swing for the fences, just like Apple seems to have done. 

This brings a sense of déjà vu for some of us tech watchers. I&#8217;m reminded of how the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad were ridiculed by people who did not see their potential when they were announced.
