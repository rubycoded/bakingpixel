The Guardian discusses [the impact of the value trap on Windows PC makers](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/09/pc-value-trap-windows-chrome-hp-dell-lenovo-asus-acer).

> The problem for Windows PC makers is that they are caught in the &#8220;value trap&#8221;. Even as prices are being forced down by commoditisation and slumping demand, they have no obvious way to capture any of the money that a consumer who buys one of their products subsequently spends with it. 

A comparison reveals the stark difference in profitability between Mac and Windows machines.

> And how profitable are Macs on their own, even without that revenue stream? Apple doesn&#8217;t break out the figure for Mac profitability. But Horace Dediu of the Asymco consultancy reckons there&#8217;s a good-enough rule of thumb: assume that Macs have an 18.9% profit margin, which fits well enough with its historical operating margins.
> 
> That metric gives a hardware per-PC profit which has dropped from $241 to $232 &#8211; an erosion, certainly, but a margin that Windows PC makers would kill for: it&#8217;s more than 10 times greater than their per-PC profit. 

LG and Sony are leaving the PC market. Acer might be the next in line if it does not [turn its fortunes around](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/acer-ceo/).
