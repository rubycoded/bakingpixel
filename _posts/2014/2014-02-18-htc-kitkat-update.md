Ars Technica reports on [HTC blaming Nvidia for Kitkat update delays](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/02/htc-actively-exploring-kitkat-update-for-one-x-blames-nvidia-for-delay/). This comes after [HTC published a webpage last month to explain the delay in the update to Android 4.4](http://bakingpixel.com/2014/01/htc-explains-updates/).

> Apparently, the outcry from One X owners was loud enough that HTC is &#8220;actively exploring&#8221; the possibility of a KitKat upgrade. Without support from Nvidia, though, the One X+ and international One X will remain stuck on Android 4.2. When asked why certain Tegra 3-based products like the 2012 Nexus 7 could support Android 4.4 but the One X+ couldn&#8217;t, the team blamed slight differences in the various Tegra 3 SoCs. 

It’ll be interesting to see what Nvidia has to say about these “slight differences”.
