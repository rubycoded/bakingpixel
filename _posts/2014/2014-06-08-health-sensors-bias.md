TheNextWeb claims that [Apple&#8217;s Health app needs to do three things or it will be considered a flop](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/06/07/tracking-enough-three-things-apples-health-app-must-make-us-healthier/).

> If they try to play it safe, however, and just some add Apple polish to the same tracking technologies already on the market, Health will flop. It will end up on the shelf with other beautifully designed, but seldom used, Apple products. Remember the Newton? The G4 Cube? 

Compare this to how TheNextWeb [reacted to Samsung&#8217;s health event](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/05/28/samsung-introduces-simband-modular-health-band-powered-open-source-sami-platform/).
