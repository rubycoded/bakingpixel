Ars Technica reports on [two Android apps that secretly mine Litecoin and Dogecoin](http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/03/apps-with-millions-of-google-play-downloads-covertly-mine-cryptocurrency/).

> Users with phones and tablets that are suddenly charging slowly, running hot, or quickly running out of batteries may want to consider if they have been exposed to this or similar threats. Also, just because an app has been downloaded from an app store – even Google Play – does not mean it is safe. 

Google Play is not secure. But lack of outrage regarding the matter is rather disturbing. Are Android users more concerned about how the mining could be done even more discreetly, rather than be alarmed that their phones are used for something they were unaware of, without their consent?
