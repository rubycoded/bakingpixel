Apple Insider reports that [US carriers have agreed to a standard set of rules for unlocking mobile devices](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/12/12/us-carriers-agree-to-standard-set-of-rules-for-unlocking-phones-tablets).

> We believe this agreement will continue to foster the world-leading range of devices and offerings that Americans enjoy today,&#8221; CTIA President and CEO Steve Largent said in a statement. &#8220;The robust and differentiated technological ecosystem has brought unparalleled and world-leading benefits to American wireless users, in the form of high-end and affordable devices, post- and pre-paid options, and with the world&#8217;s most advanced devices being launched first in the United States. 

I never had problems because I live in a place where phone-locking is forbidden. Good to see that the big four in the US are finally coming to their senses.
