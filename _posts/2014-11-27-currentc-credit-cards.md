If merchants simply needed a place to push out more coupons and drive more business, they could have partnered with Google or Apple. But they didn’t. They set up their own payment processing capabilities, because the real impetus here is avoiding interchange fees.

CurrentC helps retailers cut out the commission paid to credit card companies. [As I have said before](http://bakingpixel.com/2014/11/yahoo-finance-apple-pay/), consumers are more likely to prefer sticking to using credit cards. On top of the rewards you earn through your cards, there&#8217;s consumer safety through programs such as travel insurance, extended product warranties. Don&#8217;t like the product you bought with your card? Return it through the credit card&#8217;s return policy. Some credit cards run instalment policies that allows you to manage cash flow.

For CurrentC to actually be able to compete, it would have to offer consumers such attractive benefits. Otherwise, it is hard to see it succeeding.
