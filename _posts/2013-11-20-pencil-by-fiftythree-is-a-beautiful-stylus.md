I already own a Wacom Bamboo and Adonit Jot and I&#8217;ve been drooling over the [Adonit Jot Evernote edition stylus](https://www.evernote.com/market/feature/stylus) recently, but [this](http://www.fiftythree.com/pencil) is the stylus I want for Christmas.

[Putting Pencil to Paper: FiftyThree debuts the best iPad stylus yet](http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/19/5119390/putting-pencil-to-paper-fiftythree-debuts-the-best-ipad-stylus-yet)

> Today, the company has finally thrown its hat in the ring with Pencil, a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stylus for tablets. FiftyThree’s first hardware device ships today in two models: walnut hardwood, for $59.95, and aluminum “graphite,” for $49.95. The walnut model has built-in magnets, like the Applydea Maglus, so you can stick it to an Apple Smart Cover, or to your fridge. Each Pencil also has an “eraser” on its top, so when you flip it over, Paper automatically activates its eraser tool. The device comes with an extra tip and eraser, and also ships with Paper’s full range of digital brushes, like the watercolor brush, which usually retail for $1.99 each (or $6.99 as a pack) inside the app.
