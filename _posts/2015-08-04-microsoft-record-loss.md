Reuters reported on [Microsoft&#8217;s record loss as it writes down Nokia](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/21/us-microsoft-results-idUSKCN0PV28Z20150721).

> Microsoft Corp reported a $3.2 billion quarterly net loss, its biggest ever, as the company wrote down its Nokia phone business and demand fell for its Windows operating system. 

No big deal. It&#8217;s just $3.2 billion loss. I mean, look at Apple, they are in trouble with [a record $7.7 billion profit](http://bakingpixel.com/2015/08/apple-third-quarter/).
