There are no shortage of social apps out there, though with the support of Billionaire Carlos Slim and Latin America’s biggest wireless carrier, [Mobli](http://www.mobli.com/) could be a force to be reckoned with.

> Mobli is like Instagram but with extra features, including hash tagging for locations and a direct messaging service. Hogeg got the idea for the app when he was at a concert and saw the audience filming and photographing the performers. “I wanted to connect the eyes of everyone,” he said, adding that Mobli now has the second-largest database of photos and videos among mobile apps, after Instagram.
