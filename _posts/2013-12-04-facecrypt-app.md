PetaPixel writes about [FaceCrypt, an iOS app that locks your encrypted data using a selfie](http://petapixel.com/2013/12/01/facecrypt-ios-app-lets-use-selfie-secure-passwords/).

> Instead of using your standard password, all of your info — be it passwords, photos, credit card numbers, passport data or that note reminding you where you hid the kids Christmas presents — is locked inside of a vault that can only be opened using biometric face recognition and a selfie… although we suggest you keep a straight face since duck lips might throw the system off. 

What if someone tries to bypass the system using a picture of you?

> To keep things even safer, individual ‘drawers’ in the vault can be locked with additional security measures; and the app can be set to prompt the user to blink so that someone with a picture of you can’t access the app by holding up your mug shot.
