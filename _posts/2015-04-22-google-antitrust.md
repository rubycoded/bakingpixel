WSJ reported on [the US antitrust probe of Google](http://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-u-s-antitrust-probe-of-google-1426793274).

> In discussing one of the issues the FTC staff wanted to sue over, the report said the company illegally took content from rival websites such as Yelp, TripAdvisor Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to improve its own websites. It cited one instance when Google copied Amazon’s sales rankings to rank its own items. It also copied Amazon’s reviews and ratings, the report found. Spokesmen for TripAdvisor and Amazon declined to comment.
> 
> When competitors asked Google to stop taking their content, it threatened to remove them from its search engine.
> 
> “It is clear that Google’s threat was intended to produce, and did produce, the desired effect,” the report said, “which was to coerce Yelp and TripAdvisor into backing down.” The company also sent a message that it would “use its monopoly power over search to extract the fruits of its rivals’ innovations.” 

Shocking.
