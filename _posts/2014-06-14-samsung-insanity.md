> By my count, Samsung has now announced 11 different Android tablets since the start of 2014 (and it’s entirely possible I’m forgetting a few). In the past five months alone, the company has launched the following devices:
> 
>   * Galaxy Tab S 8.4
>   * Galaxy Tab S 10.5
>   * Galaxy Tab 4 7.0
>   * Galaxy Tab 4 8.0

>   * Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4
>   * Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1
>   * Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2
>   * Galaxy Note Pro 12.2
>   * Galaxy Tab 3 Lite
> 
> And that&#8217;s not all. Samsung also still sells another 11 Android tablets from the recent past:
> 
>   * Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition)
>   * Galaxy Tab 3 7.0

Put yourselves in the shoes of an average consumer who does not keep up with the tablet market. How are you able to decide on the tablet to get?

Compare that with Apple’s latest line of iPad Air and iPad Mini, and the older models still available, the fourth generation iPad and non-Retina iPad Mini. From a consumer’s perspective, it is easy to choose an iPad:

  1. Full-sized or Mini? 
      * Full-sized:  
        On a budget? 4th-gen iPad.  
        If you want a slimmer profile or more capacity, get the Air.
      * Mini: It’s a choice of whether you want a Retina display.
  2. Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi with 4G LTE?
