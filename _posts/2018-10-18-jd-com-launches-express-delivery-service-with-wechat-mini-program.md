TechNode reported that [JD.com launches express delivery service with WeChat mini-program](https://technode.com/2018/10/18/jd-express-delivery-wechat/).

> The e-commerce platform’s logistics subsidiary has offered supply chain and logistics services for retailers since launching in 2017. However, the latest news marks the company’s first foray into the field of express delivery in China. The service is currently available for individual customers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, although the company plans to eventually expand across the country.
> 
> A WeChat mini-program named “JD Express” (京东快递) currently offers mostly standard options for shipping packages, with a couple exceptions. 

I&#8217;ve been using this service for a while. Usually I just get the JD delivery guy to ship items when he drops off my purchases. It&#8217;s not publicised much. I got to know about it only because the delivery guy mentioned it during one of our chats. JD delivery guys are very friendly and go the extra mile to provide a great service experience, so the guys servicing my area have become acquaintances.
