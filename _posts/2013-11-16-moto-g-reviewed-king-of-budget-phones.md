In Asia and other emerging markets, it&#8217;s common to see many cheap Android phones being sold. Considering that they&#8217;re usually a mix of a low-end display, underpowered processor, a tiny bit of RAM, it&#8217;s no suprise that the user experience is often horrible. At $179, the Google-owned Motorola is continuing Google&#8217;s initative to offer decent off-contract low-priced Android phones. Certainly a win for consumers.

> It is fast, fluid, with a sharp 4.5in screen and a long battery life that’s more than enough to get you through even the most arduous of work days – something most premium phones costing three times as much as the Moto G struggle with.
