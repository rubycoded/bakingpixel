Independent.ie reports on how a school’s [switch to e-books had a disastrous end](http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/education/switch-to-ebooks-was-an-unmitigated-disaster-says-school-principal-29767084.html).

> Students experienced problems such as tablets failing to switch on, tablets spontaneously going into sleep mode, devices looping while performing automatic repairs, system board failures and issues with wi-fi.
> 
> Principal Gleeson said it was “an informed decision” to choose the HP Elite tablet.
> 
> “A year and a half’s worth of research was put into choosing the right device for us.” 

They cannot blame anyone if they chose the HP Elite Pad after 18 months of research for the right device.
