$200 isn&#8217;t exactly cheap, though if you like tinkering and customization, this is definitely a cool project.

[Build your own cellphone for $200](http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/28/5154536/how-to-build-your-own-cellphone-mit-media-lab-david-mellis)

> Currently at MIT&#8217;s Media Lab, Mellis has put all of the plans necessary to build and customize the phone up on Github, and also uploaded the circuit board plans to custom printer OSH Park, which will print three copies of the board for around $60. As for the casing, there are detailed instructions for a simple laser-cut plywood case, but several Media Lab members have crafted their own cases in a variety of shapes and hues, using milling, laser cutting, and 3D printing. Mellis describes his DIY phone as &#8220;a difficult but potentially do-able project&#8221; that should cost around $200 to complete.
