If you&#8217;re used to listening to music on Winamp or [Foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org), iTunes will often feel pretty bloated. It&#8217;s great as a music library, but with increased competition from streaming services such as Spotify, Rdio and Pandora, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if iTunes can evolve fast enough to fend off these new challengers.

> What was once an MP3 player has grown into a monstrosity. What started life as SoundJam MP can barely recognize itself in the mirror these days. iTunes can rip and burn CDs (that used to be a big deal, kids), be used to purchase music and other media, stream radio, listen to podcasts, watch movies and sync to not only iPods, but iPhones and iPads, too. 

iTunes Radio is definitely a response to streaming music, but it has yet to reach many markets where Spotify and other services are already available.

The music wars are heating up again.
