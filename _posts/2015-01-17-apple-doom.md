Cult of Mac reported on [analyst Abhey Lamba&#8217;s prediction of doom for Apple](http://www.cultofmac.com/309223/rip-apple-analyst-predicts-doom-apple-watch/).

> In a note published Thursday, Lamba argued that AAPL shares could fall by 20 percent this year as iPhone sales slow down, and the Apple Watch isn’t enough to offset this decline.
> 
> While F1Q15 results will likely be extremely solid and March guidance could indicate continued momentum, we believe iPhone sales will decelerate more than normal later in the year,” said the guidance note to clients. “Additionally, our checks indicate that Apple Watch sales could be disappointing and other categories are unlikely to offset the slowdown in iPhone sales creating pressure on out-year estimates.” 

That makes a lot of sense when you consider this:

> With the company coming off its [most profitable iPhone launch ever](http://www.cultofmac.com/297139/apple-sold-10-million-iphone-6-6-plus-handsets-launch-weekend/), exciting new devices on the horizon and a stock price that [recently hit an all-time high](http://www.cultofmac.com/304182/apple-reaches-record-700-billion-market-cap/), what else is there for the self-respecting analyst to do but predict that doom is right around the corner?
