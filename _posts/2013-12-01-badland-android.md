AllThingsD reports that [Frogmind’s Badland is now available on Android](http://allthingsd.com/20131129/indie-platformer-badland-finally-comes-to-android-but-with-a-new-business-model/).

> The addicting and arty game launched on iOS in March for $4, and last month came to BlackBerry World at the same price. But, after talking with other mobile developers, Frogmind decided to go free-to-play for the game’s Android release, adding 15-second interstitial ads and two in-app purchases: One just removes the ads, while the other removes the ads and unlocks the second half of the game, for a total of 80 levels. 

I really like Badland. To say that it is addictive is an understatement. I got it when it was first released on iOS and I was sucked into the game until I completed it.

I suspect that Frogmind chose this business model on Android to appeal to the different kind of buyers in the Google Play store. With the popularity of its iOS and BlackBerry versions, I believe that making the app available for free will propel it to further success on Android.

It is a no-brainer to download the game since it is free. Go get it now if you are on Android. I won’t be surprised if you end up paying to unlock the full game.
