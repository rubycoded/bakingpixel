Reuters reported on [Apple seeking an injunction against Samsung for patent infringement](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/04/us-apple-samsung-elec-patent-idUSKBN0M02BR20150304).

> Samsung lawyer Kathleen Sullivan of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP said the South Korean company had all but stopped using the patents, so no injunction was needed. 

So Samsung was using the patents.
