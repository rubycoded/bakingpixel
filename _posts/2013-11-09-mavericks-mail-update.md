Apple has [updated the Mail app for OS X Mavericks](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6030) with a few fixes.

>   * Fixes an issue that prevents deleting, moving, and archiving messages for users with custom Gmail settings
>   * Addresses an issue that may cause unread counts to be inaccurate
>   * Includes additional fixes that improve the compatibility and stability of Mail

Previously I reported on [problems using Gmail with the Mail app on Mavericks](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/gmail-mavericks/) and [some people are even ditching Gmail](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/goodbye-gmail/) due to the issues with Mail app.
