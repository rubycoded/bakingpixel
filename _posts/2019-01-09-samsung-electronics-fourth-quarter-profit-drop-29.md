Reuters reported that [Samsung Electronics says weak chip demand sent fourth-quarter profit well below market estimates](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-results/samsung-electronics-says-weak-chip-demand-sent-fourth-quarter-profit-well-below-market-estimates-idUSKCN1P12C7).

> Samsung Electronics surprised the market on Tuesday with an estimated 29 percent drop in quarterly profit, blaming weak chip demand in a rare commentary issued to “ease confusion” among investors already fretting about a global tech slowdown. 

This comes after [LG reported a drop in profit](https://bakingpixel.com/2019/01/lg-electronics-sees-80-percent-drop-in-fourth-quarter-profit/) as well.
