That&#8217;s the general feedback that I get from Android users I know. They often end up using the passcode because it&#8217;s faster that way.

User feedback isn’t generally an ideal way to design security features. After all, many people also enjoy using the same weak passwords across all their internet accounts. 

Perhaps the fingerprint reader is more popular because the face recognition method doesn&#8217;t quite work as expected?
