When Apple unveiled its 64-bit A7 processor, Qualcomm&#8217;s Chief Marketing Officer gave its PR team a huge headache by saying that 64-bit on mobile was a marketing gimmick and offered no benefit to the end user. Unsurprisingly, he was [removed from the leadership team and reassigned](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57609038-37/after-apple-64-bit-a7-criticism-qualcomm-exec-reassigned/).

Of course, there is a certain amount of truth to his claims. As of now, most apps haven&#8217;t been designed to take advantage of the 64-bit architecture, and as mobile phones generally don&#8217;t have 4 gigabytes of RAM, the benefits of a 64-bit isn&#8217;t immediately noticeable. But things change very quickly in the mobile scene and app developers out there are already updating their apps to take advantage of the new chips.

That brief backstory is probably going to accompany every article out there covering the fact that Qualcomm has just introduced its [Snapdragon 410](http://www.qualcomm.com/media/releases/2013/12/09/qualcomm-technologies-introduces-snapdragon-410-chipset-integrated-4g-lte) 64-bit chip that has integrated LTE. Without going into details of 64-bit chips, it&#8217;ll be the integrated LTE that will be tempting for me. Most of the top end phones currently support LTE connectivity, but once LTE support is available in more chips, I hope to see even budget phones offer LTE support. You can expect to see this chip surface in devices in the second half od 2014.

> Qualcomm has just announced the Snapdragon 410 chipset series, which is Qualcomm’s first announced processor with 64-bit support, but it’s actually more interesting because it aims to make integrated 4G LTE support a lot more affordable for device manufacturers. They plan to launch the 410 as a manufacturing sample by the first half of next year, which means it could be in shipping phones by this time in 2014.
