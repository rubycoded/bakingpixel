Leo Kelion reported for BBC News that [Google chief: I&#8217;d disclose smart speakers before guests enter my home](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50048144).

> After being challenged as to whether homeowners should tell guests smart devices &#8211; such as a Google Nest speaker or Amazon Echo display &#8211; are in use before they enter the building, he concludes that the answer is indeed yes.

> &#8220;Does the owner of a home need to disclose to a guest? I would and do when someone enters into my home, and it&#8217;s probably something that the products themselves should try to indicate.&#8221; 

Surprised? Even if the manufacturer isn&#8217;t malicious, there is always the risk of the device being hacked.
