This has been going on for years, and instead of fixing the issue, it does seem like Facebook is always coming up with new ways to circumvent user control and consume more energy.

I uninstalled Facebook almost more than a year ago and have noticed improvement in the battery life. Whenever friends or relatives complain about battery life, Facebook always tops the battery usage list. I surf Facebook in Safari and it is more than enough.

I use the Facebook Messenger app more than the actual Facebook app so there&#8217;s no need for the app, which is a big source of distraction on top of being a battery sink.
