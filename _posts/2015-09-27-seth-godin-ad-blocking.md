>   * The best way to contact your users is by earning the privilege to contact them, over time.

>   * Horizontally spread ideas (person to person) are far more effective than top-down vertical advertising.
>   * More data isn&#8217;t the point. Data to serve explicit promises is the point.

>   * Media properties that celebrate their ads (like Vogue) will continue to thrive, because the best advertising is the advertising we would miss if it was gone.

We have become so numb to advertising that most of us unconsciously ignore the ads when we browse website. Ad blockers just help us save bandwidth by not loading the ads and protects our privacy by blocking tracking by ad networks.
