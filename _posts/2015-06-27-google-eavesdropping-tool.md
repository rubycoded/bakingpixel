The Guardian reported on [Google&#8217;s eavesdropping tool installed without permission](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/23/google-eavesdropping-tool-installed-computers-without-permission).

> “Without consent, Google’s code had downloaded a black box of code that – according to itself – had turned on the microphone and was actively listening to your room,” said Rick Falkvinge, the Pirate party founder, in a blog post. “Which means that your computer had been stealth configured to send what was being said in your room to somebody else, to a private company in another country, without your consent or knowledge, an audio transmission triggered by … an unknown and unverifiable set of conditions.” 

Google claims it is an opt-in, but it turns out to be an opt-out.

> Falkvinge countered Google’s explanations saying: “The default install will still wiretap your room without your consent, unless you opt out, and more importantly, know that you need to opt out, which is nowhere a reasonable requirement.” He says a hardware switch to disable the microphone and camera built into most computers is needed. 

One more reason not to use Chrome.
