Gigaom reported on [Samsung TVs inserting ads into third party content](https://gigaom.com/2015/02/10/samsung-tvs-start-inserting-ads-into-your-movies/).

> Thought you could watch that video on your local hard drive without ads? Think again: A number of owners of Samsung’s smart TVs are reporting this week that their TV sets started to interrupt their movie viewing with Pepsi ads, which seem to be dynamically inserted into third-party content.
> 
> “Every movie I play 20-30 minutes in it plays the pepsi ad, no audio but crisp clear ad. It has happened on 6 movies today,” a user reported on Reddit, where a number of others were struggling with the same problem. 

You pay for your device but you are forced to watch advertisements. If Samsung are earning from the ads, shouldn&#8217;t they be giving away the TV for free? Watch out for Samsung phones that forces you to watch advertisements.
