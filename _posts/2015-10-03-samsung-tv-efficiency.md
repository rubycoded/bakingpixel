Boing Boing reported on [Samsung being accused of programming TVs to cheat energy efficiency ratings](http://boingboing.net/2015/10/02/dieselgate-for-tvs-samsung-ac.html).

> Samsung admits that its TVs radically changed their power-consumption during testing, but say that the low-power mode was inadvertently triggered by the tests, and was meant to be an automatic power-saving feature. 

If it&#8217;s a power saving feature, why is it only activated during tests and not in real-world usage?
