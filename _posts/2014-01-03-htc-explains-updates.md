HTC has published a webpage to [show the Android 4.4 upgrade status of its HTC One phones](http://www.htc.com/us/go/htc-software-updates/).

They even have a large diagram depicting the complicated process of an Android update as an excuse for not having the latest Android version on their flagship devices. This means that the other Android makers are blindingly efficient to be able to roll out KitKat on their devices then!
