[Horace Dediu writes on how big iTunes is](http://www.asymco.com/2014/02/10/fortune-130/).

> On a yearly basis iTunes/Software/Services is nearly half of Google’s core business and growing slightly faster. 

The iTunes “empire” of content and services would be ranked as number 130 in the Fortune 500 ranking of companies (slightly below Alcoa and above Eli Lilly).
