Reuters reported on [Samsung&#8217;s fight to save mobile market share](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/04/us-samsung-elec-smartphones-idUSKCN0Q906L20150804).

> Behind Samsung&#8217;s reality-check is the fact it is stuck with the same Android operating system used by its low-cost competitors, who are producing increasingly-capable phones of their own.
> 
> &#8220;The writing has long been on the wall for any premium Android maker: as soon as low endÂ hardware became &#8216;good enough,&#8217; there would be no reason to buy a premium brand,&#8221; said Ben Thompson, an analyst at Stratechery.com in Taipei. 

It&#8217;s a race to the bottom for Android makers. It is not something surprising. We just need to look at the PC market to expect what the trend would be like.
