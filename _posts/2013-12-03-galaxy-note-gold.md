Android Central reports that [Samsung has announced three new colours for its Galaxy Note 3](http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-announces-merlot-red-and-rose-gold-black-and-white-galaxy-note-3s).

Its black and white models now comes with rose gold versions that has gold instead of silver accents. It also unveiled a merlot red version.

[HTC launched a gold version of its HTC One](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/htc-introduces-gold-colored-htc-one-for-the-masses/) after producing a limited edition in real gold. After launching a limited edition gold Galaxy S4, Samsung is bringing gold to the mass market with the gold Galaxy Note 3.

I think we are way past the debate on whether a gold phone appeals to the public. The gold iPhone 5s has silenced the critics.

Samsung doesnâ€™t seem to understand that a gold plastic phone feels completely different from a gold aluminium phone.
