Trevor Mogg reported for Digital Trends that [Amazon Prime to get faster deliveries with one-day shipping pledge](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/amazon-prime-to-get-faster-deliveries-with-one-day-shipping-pledge/).

> Amazon already offers some Prime members one-day shipping, and even a two-hour delivery service called Prime Now, but it’s only available in selected areas and covers a limited range of goods. Its long-standing two-day unlimited shipping pledge covers its entire Prime membership base and it’s this that the company wants to reduce to just a single day, though Olsavsky hinted that several of its delivery time frames could eventually merge into one. 

I amazes me that you need to pay for same day or next day delivery. In China, JD provides same day delivery for orders placed before 10 am and next day delivery for orders placed before 11 pm without any additional costs.
