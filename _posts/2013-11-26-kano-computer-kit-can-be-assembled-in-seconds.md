A simple computer that can be easily assembled and function as a introduction to computers. An ambitious project that I like. If the [OLPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child) offers any insight, it&#8217;s that this won&#8217;t be easy to pull off. Still, it&#8217;s a good concept that I hope succeeds. The good news is that it has already reached its funding goal many times over, so step one is done.

> At its heart, Kano is essentially a Raspberry Pi kit but it goes further by providing a plug-and-play learning environment that anyone, including children as young as eight, can get up and running within minutes.
> 
> Asking for $100,000 in funding on Kickstarter, Kano is available as a kit for a $99 pledge, or for a $199 “get one, give one” pledge funders will get one for themselves and one will be donated to a sponsored child.
