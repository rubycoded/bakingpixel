A common barb thrown at Apple is that the company uses outdated hardware and sells them at premium prices. If you look at things like the Retina Display, TouchID, and many more, you&#8217;ll know that the statement isn&#8217;t true.

We recently [confirmed](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/12/qualcomm-introduces-64-bit-chips-with-integrated-lte/) that Qualcomm should be offering 64-bit chips in the second half of 2014, which is roughly a year after Apple introduced the 64-bit A7 processor. At the very least, it&#8217;s good to see that Apple&#8217;s move is increasing the speed that new competing devices will have 64-bit processors, which is a benefit to consumers.

> “The 64-bit Apple chip hit us in the gut,” says the Qualcomm employee. “Not just us, but everyone, really. We were slack-jawed, and stunned, and unprepared. It’s not that big a performance difference right now, since most current software won’t benefit. But in Spinal Tap terms it’s like, 32 more, and now everyone wants it.”
