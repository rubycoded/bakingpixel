Most folks who use the Internet might not be concerned, or even know of, the issue of [net neutrality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality), but if we don&#8217;t take it seriously, it&#8217;s the consumers that will lose out in the end.

Web and mobile companies will live or die not on the merits of their technology and design, but on the deals they can strike with AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, and others. This means large phone and cable companies will be able to “shakedown” startups and established companies in every sector, requiring payment for reliable service. In fact, during the oral argument in the current case, Verizon’s lawyer said, “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these [FCC] rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.”

Ignorance. Competition. Vengeance. Whatever. Or, no reason at all.
