Ben Brooks recently wrote a [good article](https://brooksreview.net/2014/07/sweet-sweet-ipad/) on using an iPad as his main machine, it&#8217;s something that has been attempted by many folks in the past, but I like his take on it.

> As I said, this is a setup I am likely to use more and more. With iOS 8 extensions coming I think the gap between what most people need to do on a Mac each day, and what the iPad can do well, is closing faster than many suspect. At this point it’s not a person clamoring for better apps, that do more powerful things, it’s just a matter of fine tuning what we already have.

One thing that came to mind was the fact that OS X and iOS 8 and being linked closer than ever before. It wasn&#8217;t too long ago that people were debating if we needed a full desktop operating system on our mobile devices. Microsoft tried that with Windows 8, and is still trying to fine tune the product. Apple on the other hand is focusing on giving the best of both worlds, but linking them beautifully together with [Continuity](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/continuity/).
