Tech in Asia reported that [Google is investing $550m into JD.com in a strategic partnership](https://www.techinasia.com/google-strategic-investment-jd-com).

> Most of Google’s services are still banned in China, but the US tech behemoth is trickling into that market in various other ways. Today, it announced that it’s pouring US$550 million into ecommerce powerhouse JD.com as part of a “strategic partnership” between the two.
> 
> Under the deal, Google and JD plan to jointly develop a range of online shopping solutions in regions outside China – specifically, Southeast Asia, the US, and Europe. JD will start selling products through the Google Shopping platform, an aggregator for ecommerce sites based on product search. 

It is a tough battle against Alibaba for JD in both the domestic and international markets, that&#8217;s why it partners with Tencent in China to compete against Jack Ma&#8217;s ecommerce behemoth. Logical move to team up with Google in the international market. For Google, it&#8217;s a way to get a foot into the world&#8217;s largest market that it has no access to.
