I guess Beats comparisons are on the way.

> The lineup, first introduced in April, is led by Level Over, a $349.99 pair of over-ear Bluetooth headphones with active noise cancellation, NFC pairing, and what Samsung claims is &#8220;powerful, clear, sharp sound.&#8221; They can also be plugged in thanks to a detachable audio cable (with microphone and remote controls for your smartphone). And if you don&#8217;t like the way Level Over headphones sound out of the box, Samsung also offers an Android app that allows for EQ customization, or what the company refers to as &#8220;SoundAlive.&#8221; Hopefully you&#8217;d be able to find some way of making them sound great for that price tag.
