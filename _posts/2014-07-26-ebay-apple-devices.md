Computerworld reported on [the resales of older Apple devices on eBay](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9249957/The_other_Apple_economy_2B_in_devices_on_eBay).

> Like one of an infinite number of multiverses, eBay&#8217;s traffic in primarily old-but-still-sellable Apple goods mirrored, more or less, Apple&#8217;s product line breakdown. The iPhone dominated on the online auction site, accounting for 55% the $1.94 billion in sales of Apple goods. Meanwhile, Mac products accounted for 20% of Apple sales on eBay and iPad sales represented 19% of the total.
