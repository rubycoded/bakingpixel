TechCrunch reports that [smart appliances are starting to spawn spambots and make the home vulnerable to hackers](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/16/hurray-hackers-and-spambots-are-going-after-your-fridges-and-smart-tvs-now/).

> Example A: according to a new study by security firm Proofpoint, hackers have already started crackinâ€™ away at smart appliances in hopes of further expanding their zombie spambot armies. Between December 26th, 2013 and January 6th, 2014, Proofpoint says they detected upwards of 750,000 spam emails being sent from over 100,000 compromised routers, multimedia centers, smart TVs, and, in one case, a smart fridge. 

There needs to be a way for users to secure the connected home network. Rolling out automatic updates would make keeping the softwares up to date easier.
