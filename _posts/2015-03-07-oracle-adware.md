ZDNet reported on [Oracle bundling adware in Java for Mac](http://www.zdnet.com/article/oracle-extends-its-adware-bundling-to-include-java-for-macs/).

> For several years, Oracle has been bundling the Ask toolbar with its Java software for Windows PCs, often using deceptive methods to convince customers to install the unwanted add-on.
> 
> With the latest release of Java for the Mac, Oracle has begun bundling the Ask adware with default installations as well, changing homepages in the process. 

I have stopped using Java on my Mac for the past few years and haven&#8217;t missed it at all.
