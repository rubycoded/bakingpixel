Interesting. I&#8217;m also still keeping an eye on the [recent hurdles](http://bakingpixel.com/2015/10/thoughts-on-evernotes-recent-troubles/) that Evernote is facing.

> We at Evernote are fans of Open Source, and use a good deal of Open Source products and libraries. Now it’s time to give back to the community. During the last half year we’ve been busy preparing our localization system, writing documentation, cleaning up code. And today we’re proud to release it publicly as an open-source product! It’s called Serge, an acronym standing for ‘String Extraction and Resource Generation Engine’.
