For some reason, Google is compelled to post [a guideline for Glass users](https://sites.google.com/site/glasscomms/glass-explorers).

It is interesting to note that Google has embraced the use of the term Glasshole:

> Be creepy or rude (aka, a “Glasshole”). Respect others and if they have questions about Glass don’t get snappy. Be polite and explain what Glass does and remember, a quick demo can go a long way. In places where cell phone cameras aren’t allowed, the same rules will apply to Glass. If you’re asked to turn your phone off, turn Glass off as well. Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other Explorers. 

As [Gruber pointed out](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/02/19/google-glass-dos-donts), it is a concern if Google has to tell users not to be a creep. Does it mean that there is something fundamentally wrong with the concept of Google Glass? Such as how it will infringe on privacy.

This feels like gun makers putting up a guideline for gun owners not to shoot innocent people. Except that gun makers don’t do that.
