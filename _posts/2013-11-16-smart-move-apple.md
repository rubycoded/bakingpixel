Ed Dale thinks Apple’s soft launch of the Retina iPad mini [was a brilliant move](http://www.eddale.co/general/smart-move-apple).

> By soft releasing the iPad Mini Retina, Apple achieved three crucial things.  
> * Apple’s biggest fans got theirs first. Who knew about this first? The people who follow the Apple blogs and digerati. Judging by Twitter, this worked perfectly.  
> * The grey market queing for the iPad Mini Retina was going to be immense. By going online the incredibly poor optics (The front of Apple lines, which attracts a lot of media, was full of people who were not fans but paid to be there) are mitigated.  
> * The last thing Apple wants is 100’s of customers turning up everyday to be dissapointed in a store which is meant to be a happy place – Apple does not want their stores to be associated with disappointment and frustration!!
