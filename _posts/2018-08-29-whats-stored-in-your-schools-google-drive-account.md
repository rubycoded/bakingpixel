Missouri Education Watchdog reported that [what Google Drive&#8217;s school account stores](http://missourieducationwatchdog.com/whats-stored-in-your-school-google-drive-account-you-might-be-surprised/).

> The Elys claim that the SPS Google Drive, given to all SPS employees and students, automatically begins to store information from any device the drive is accessed on. This includes browser history, but also personal information such as files and passwords. They add that even if you log out of the drive, it stays running and recording in the background.

> With more searching, the Elys have now found even more sensitive information that’s been stored to their daughter’s Google Drive, including 139 passwords to both her and her husband’s different accounts and also voice recordings of both her and her children.
> 
> &#8220;My voice to text was being stored as well as any search my kids did, and I could say ‘sure my daughter was searching on Google,’ but my phone uses Safari. When I used my texting app on my iPhone, it recorded my voice, as well as typing out the words and saving it on my Google Drive,” said Brette Hay, the Ely’s daughter and a teacher at Pershing Middle School. 

Shocking? Not shocking that they log so much data. Shocking that they store passwords and all your voice input unencrypted.
