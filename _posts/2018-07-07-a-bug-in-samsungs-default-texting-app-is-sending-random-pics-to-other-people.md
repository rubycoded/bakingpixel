Gizmodo reported that [a bug in Samsung&#8217;s default texting app is sending random pics to other people](https://gizmodo.com/a-bug-in-samsungs-default-texting-app-is-sending-random-1827291759).

> According to user reports, the problem stems from Samsung Messages, the default texting app on Galaxy devices, which (for reasons that haven’t been determined), is erroneously sending pictures stored on the devices to random contacts via SMS. One user on Reddit even claims that instead of sending one pic, Samsung Messages sent out their entire photo gallery to a contact in the middle of the night. 

Scary.

> The scariest part about this bug is that when Samsung Messages bugs out sends pics to other people, it reportedly doesn’t leave any evidence of it doing so, which means people may not know their photos have been released into the wild until it’s too late. 

Are you using a Samsung Galaxy device now? What if your phone has been sending this out and you didn&#8217;t know because the people receiving your photos aren&#8217;t saying anything?
