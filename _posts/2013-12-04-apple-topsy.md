Business Insider reports that [Apple has bought Topsy, a Twitter analytics company](http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-acquires-social-media-analytics-company-topsy-2013-12).

> Topsy is one of the companies paying for access to Twitter&#8217;s firehose of data. It analyzes tweets looking for trends. 

It is possible that Apple is looking to use Topsy to improve its services to make them more suitable for social engagements. It could also help Apple to provide better, more social search results.
