Google has already moved to get this in place, so it&#8217;s not surprising that Yahoo is following suit. The good news is that Microsoft seems to have plans to encrypt traffic between its data centers too. The race for privacy is on.

[Yahoo Will Follow Google In Encrypting Data Center Traffic, Customer Data Flow By Q1 ’14](http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/18/yahoo-will-follow-google-in-encrypting-data-center-traffic-all-traffic-between-company-and-customers-by-q1-14/)

> The announcement today comes in the wake of Google making similar moves (which began last year). Google began encrypting the traffic between its data centers after the exposure of a joint NSA-GCHQ program known as MUSCULAR, which outlined a system in which it spliced itself into communications between the company’s servers to gather data on surveillance subjects. The MUSCULAR project also targeted Yahoo directly, as shown in government documents obtained by Edward Snowden and exposed by The Washington Post.
