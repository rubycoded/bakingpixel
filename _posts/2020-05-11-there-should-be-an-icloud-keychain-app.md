    The problem with managing passwords on iOS and macOS at the moment is the functions are scattered around. Some of the syncing happens on in the backend with no way to quickly see (especially on iOS). A prime example of this is the syncing of Wi-Fi passwords. It’s easy to remove old networks on the Mac, but on iOS, it’s all happened without being able to remove anything.

Keychain stores passwords based on the url it was entered, so you have to search by the domain name. And you can&#8217;t group different urls under the same password. These are two major reasons I&#8217;m still on 1Password.

And also the ability to generate 2FA codes that&#8217;s automatically copied to the clipboard.
