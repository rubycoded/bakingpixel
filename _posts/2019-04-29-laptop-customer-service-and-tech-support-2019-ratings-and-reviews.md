Laptop released its [customer service and tech support: 2019 ratings and reviews](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/tech-support-showdown).

> Apple has dominated the top spot in our rankings for the past few years, and that hasn&#8217;t changed for 2019. The Cupertino company&#8217;s tech support agents continue to be among the fastest and most knowledgeable in the business, delivering accurate answers to our Mac questions across live chat, social media and over the phone. 

Apple has taken very good care of me and my 2012 MacBook Pro. Superb service that solved my issues. Cleaned up my device free of charge whenever I bring it in. Repaired a GPU problem for free years after my warranty ended. Very pleased with my experience with their customer service and tech support.
