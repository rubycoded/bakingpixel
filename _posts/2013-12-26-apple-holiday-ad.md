Ken Segall writes about [Apple’s holiday advertisement](http://kensegall.com/2013/12/apple-thinks-different-for-christmas/).

> Most of these people mistake their personal opinion, instinct, values and/or taste for actual marketing talent. There are tens of millions of people who will stop in their tracks at this commercial and wipe a tear from their eye. As a result, they will feel slightly more attached to Apple, which is the marketing purpose of this spot. 

Couldn’t agree more. It follows along the lines of the Life on iPad ad campaign to show how Apple devices are enriching lives.
