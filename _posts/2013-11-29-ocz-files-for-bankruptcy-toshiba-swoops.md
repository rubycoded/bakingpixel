Pretty sad news. More importantly for consumers, if you&#8217;re currently shopping for an SSD, you might want to skip OCZ as it&#8217;s not obvious whether the warranties will be honored after the dust settles.

> It&#8217;s sad to see OCZ going because they&#8217;ve been one of the pioneers in the consumer SSD industry. They were one of the most active companies when we started to see the first consumer SSDs in 2008/2009 but OCZ lost a ton of sales once Samsung and other major OEMs began to take the consumer SSD market seriously. It&#8217;s hard to say what ultimately killed OCZ without knowing their exact cost structure but I believe it was a combination of bad strategy (too many products and high production volumes) and engineering choices (low reliability) along with other things.
