Tim Cook [writes about workplace equality](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304527504579172302377638002) on Wall Street Journal.

> Long before I started work as the CEO of Apple, I became aware of a fundamental truth: People are much more willing to give of themselves when they feel that their selves are being fully recognized and embraced.

> As we see it, embracing people&#8217;s individuality is a matter of basic human dignity and civil rights. It also turns out to be great for the creativity that drives our business. We&#8217;ve found that when people feel valued for who they are, they have the comfort and confidence to do the best work of their lives.
