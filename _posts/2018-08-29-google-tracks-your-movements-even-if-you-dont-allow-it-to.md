Associated Press reported that [Google tracks your movements even if you turn of location services](https://apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb).

> An Associated Press investigation found that many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you’ve used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so. 

What&#8217;s the point of having an option to turn it off if the app continues logging the location?

> The privacy issue affects some two billion users of devices that run Google’s Android operating software and hundreds of millions of worldwide iPhone users who rely on Google for maps or search. 

Do you use Google Maps? Time to reconsider if you value your privacy.
