Jim Dalrymple reported on The Loop reported about [Apple&#8217;s record third quarter results](http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/07/21/apple-reports-record-third-quarter-results/).

> Apple on Tuesday reported a third quarter profit of $10.7 billion on revenue of $49.6 billion. This compares to revenue of $37.4 billion and net profit of $7.7 billion in the year ago quarter. 

$10.7 billion but people think Apple is losing it.
