Quartz reported on [millions of Facebook users having no idea they’re using the internet](http://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/).

> This is more than a matter of semantics. The expectations and behaviors of the next billion people to come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves. If the majority of the world’s online population spends time on Facebook, then policymakers, businesses, startups, developers, nonprofits, publishers, and anyone else interested in communicating with them will also, if they are to be effective, go to Facebook. That means they, too, must then play by the rules of one company. And that has implications for us all. 

This is a very interesting trend, and a reminder that everyone&#8217;s introduction and experiences with smartphones and the internet differ a lot.
