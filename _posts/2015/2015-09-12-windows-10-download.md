> According to The Inquirer, the situation was first reported by an anonymous reader who claimed to have discovered a hidden directory called $Windows.~BT on his computer, despite not opting in for a free upgrade to Windows 10. The directory weighed in at &#8220;3.5GB to 6GB,&#8221; according to the reader.

> “I thought Microsoft [said] this &#8216;upgrade&#8217; was optional. If so, why is it being pushed out to so many computers where it wasn&#8217;t reserved, and why does it try to install over and over again?” he told the outlet.
