The Economist released a statement on [PageFair being hacked](http://www.economist.com/help/pagefair).

> On Oct. 31, 2015, one of economist.comâ€™s vendors, PageFair, was hacked. If you visited economist.com at any time between Oct. 31, 23:52 GMT and Nov. 1, 01:15 GMT, using Windows OS and you do not have trusted anti-virus software installed, it is possible that malware, disguised as an Adobe update, was downloaded onto your PC. 

I leave websites as soon as I realise they have anti ad-blocker measures. One more reason to avoid such sites.

Also, uninstall Adobe and avoid Windows.
