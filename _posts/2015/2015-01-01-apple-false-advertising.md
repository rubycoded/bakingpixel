WSJ reported about [Apple being sued for false advertising of iPhone storage capacity](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/12/31/apple-sued-for-false-advertising-of-iphones/).

> Mann said an iPhone 6 Plus with 16 gigabytes of storage can hold only 12.7 gigabytes of photos, songs, apps and other user data. That is 21% less than the advertised 16 gigabytes of storage. For the 16GB iPhone 6, the available storage is 13 gigabytes, according to the filing. 

Anyone remember [Microsoft&#8217;s Surface Pro](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/29/3929110/surface-pro-disk-space-windows-8)?

> A company spokesperson has confirmed to The Verge that the 64GB edition of Surface Pro will have 23GB of free storage out of the box. The 128GB model will have 83GB of free storage.
