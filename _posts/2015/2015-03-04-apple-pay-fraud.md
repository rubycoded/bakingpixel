> A hot and heavy headline at the Wall Street Journal, &#8220;Fraud Comes to Apple Pay,&#8221; gives the impression of some kind of security weakness in Apple&#8217;s new payment system, but it&#8217;s not justified.

> What has happened is that Apple Pay itself is basically fraud-proof, so fraudsters have turned their attention to the next weakest link: credit cards before they&#8217;re added to an Apple Pay wallet.

Criminals use stolen credit card details (which can easily and cheaply be bought for on sites like Rescator.cm) and then trick banks into allowing them to be loaded onto an iPhone. Once loaded onto a phone, they can make purchases until the card is canceled. 

Shameful click-baiting headline to get the views.
