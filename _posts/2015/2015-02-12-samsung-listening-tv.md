BBC reported on [Samsung&#8217;s listening TV](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31296188).

> Samsung is warning customers about discussing personal information in front of their smart television set.
> 
> The warning applies to TV viewers who control their Samsung Smart TV using its voice activation feature.
> 
> When the feature is active, such TV sets &#8220;listen&#8221; to what is said and may share what they hear with Samsung or third parties, it said. 

So what does Samsung do with the information it gathers?

> The policy explains that the TV set will be listening to people in the same room to try to spot when commands or queries are issued via the remote. It goes on to say: &#8220;If your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party.&#8221; 

Creepy.
