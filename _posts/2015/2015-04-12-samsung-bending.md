> &#8220;This stuff will not bend,&#8221; she said to laughter and applause. 

The shots fired at Apple struck Samsung in its own feet when its new phones are found to be as bendable.

Marketwired reported on [SquareTrade&#8217;s New BendBot showing the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge is as bendable as the iPhone 6 Plus and is more likely to crack](http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/squaretrades-new-bendbot-shows-samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-just-as-bendable-as-apple-iphone-2006604.htm).

>   * The Samsung Galaxy S6 edge deformed at 110 pounds and created a crack in the screen. When pushed to catastrophic failure, its breaking point was 149 pounds, at which point it ceased to function.
