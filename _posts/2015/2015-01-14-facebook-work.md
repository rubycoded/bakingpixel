TechCrunch reported on [Facebook&#8217;s new Work apps and web service](http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/14/facebook-at-work-ios-android/).

> Employers can create separate log-ins for employees to use with their Work accounts, or users can link these up with their other profiles to access everything in one place.
> 
> The product puts Facebook head-to-head with the likes of Microsoft’s Yammer, Slack, Convo, Socialcast, and a huge number of others who are trying to tackle the “enterprise social network” space. Even LinkedIn conveniently let drop last night that it too was looking at building a product for coworkers to communicate and share content. 

Matt and I love Slack. It&#8217;d be interesting to see what Facebook can offer better.
