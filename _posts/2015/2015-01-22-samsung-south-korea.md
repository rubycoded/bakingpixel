Business Insider reported on [Samsung losing market share to Apple in South Korea](http://www.businessinsider.sg/iphone-6-south-korea-samsung-2015-1/).

> Apple has been particularly successful in South Korea, where Samsung has traditionally dominated its home market. Figures show that Samsung’s share has plummeted from 60% in September to 46% in November. Apple, meanwhile, has made unprecedented headway, soaring to 33%. According to Counterpoint research director Tom Kang, previously, “no foreign brand has gone beyond the 20% market share mark in the history of Korea’s smartphone industry.” 

What is significant is how the loss in Samsung&#8217;s market share is directly related to Apple&#8217;s growth.
