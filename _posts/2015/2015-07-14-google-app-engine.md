Digital Trends reported on [Google App Engine&#8217;s vulnerability to attack](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/security-researcher-blabs-that-google-app-engine-is-vulnerable-to-attack/).

> According to a report released on Seclist.org’s Full Disclosure, a new set of vulnerabilities could leave Google’s App Engine open to attack from a rudimentary Java exploit.
> 
> Seven different unpatched holes were discovered by Adam Gowdiak, CEO of the Polish security firm Security Explorations. The exploit uses the cloud platform Google App Engine to launch a defunct string of Java code, which can then be executed to break out of the first-layer sandbox and wreak havoc on protected areas of Google’s servers.
