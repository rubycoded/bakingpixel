John Gruber shared an [amusing claim chowder of the day](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/01/29/crazy-prediction).

Grartner [predicted back in 2011](http://venturebeat.com/2011/04/07/windows-phone-beat-iphon/):

> Imagine a world where Windows Phone is more popular than Apple’s iPhone.
> 
> That may just sound like Steve Ballmer’s fantasy, but a recent Gartner report claims that it may very well happen by 2015, thanks to a boost from Nokia as Microsoft’s mobile partner.
> 
> The prediction is far from crazy: I’ve argued in the past that Microsoft will doggedly fight to reclaim its mobile relevance, and it could very well achieve that with Nokia being the premiere Windows Phone 7 device maker.
