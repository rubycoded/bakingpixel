Advertising Age reported on [Twitter&#8217;s plans to add autoplaying video ads](http://adage.com/article/digital/twitter-s-video-plans-include-autoplay-ad-previews/296522/r).

> Twitter is mulling the possibility of making promoted videos automatically play 6-second previews when they pop up in people&#8217;s feeds, according to people briefed on the company&#8217;s plans. If the autoplay previews were to catch someone&#8217;s eye, that person could click to watch the full video. 

No. I instinctively close websites that have autoplay video ads, and tend to close YouTube videos that force me to watch the full ad. This is will be one more reason for me not to use Twitter.
