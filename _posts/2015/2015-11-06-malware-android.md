AppleInsider reported on [three new malware strains infecting 20,000 apps, impossible to wipe, only affect Android](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/11/05/three-new-malware-strains-infect-20k-apps-impossible-to-wipe-only-affect-android).

It is quite serious when the infection survives even a factory data wipe.
