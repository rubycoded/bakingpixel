Business insider reported on [Samsung&#8217;s epic global defeat by Apple](http://www.businessinsider.com/samsungs-decline-show-all-bets-are-off-for-android-2015-3/).

> This rapid collapse points to one thing: Samsung has weak brand loyalty.
> 
> Consumers just want a high-end, large-screened smartphone, and for years Samsung was the only one sufficiently pushing the limits of screen size. Apple’s devices remained — until the launch of the 6 and 6 Plus — around the 4-inch mark. But now Apple is producing a larger-screened device, and consumers have decided there’s no longer any reason to buy a large Samsung smartphone. 

Those who, sadly, are unable to grasp the reason behind Apple&#8217;s brand loyalty simply label loyal users as Apple fanboys and iSheep.
