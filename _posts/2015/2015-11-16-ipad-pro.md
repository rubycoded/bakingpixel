> And the question everybody should be asking is why would you want to buy an iPad Pro for nearly $1,000 when you can buy another device, such as the Microsoft Surface Pro, for almost the same price and be able to use a full desktop operating system? iOS worked on the original iPad because tablets with desktop operating systems had poor battery life and poor software features. Now, that’s changed. Apple needs to get with the times. Sure, you can run Photoshop. But can you run a full desktop version of Photoshop? The answer is no. Sure, you can edit movies in iMovie. But can you edit movies with professional software like Final Cut Pro? Unfortunately, you can’t. 

This guy probably missed how people are using iOS apps to create high quality photos, drawings, videos and music.
