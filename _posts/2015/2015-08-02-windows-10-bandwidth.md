Ubergizemo reported on [Windows 10 tapping on users&#8217; bandwidth to push updates to others](http://www.ubergizmo.com/2015/07/windows-10-bandwidth-share-updates/).

> For the most part the updates are pretty fast although it seems that with Windows 10, it looks like Microsoft is finding ways to make pushing out updates even faster, and apparently one of the ways theyâ€™re looking at is to use some of your bandwidth. As you can see in the screenshot above, this is an option that you can choose to enable or disable. 

You probably won&#8217;t mind sharing your bandwidth to help other users to download Windows 10 faster. But the option should not be enabled by default without informing users, especially when some users might have a data cap on their internet subscription.
