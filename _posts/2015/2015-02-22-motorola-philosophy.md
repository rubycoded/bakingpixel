BBC reported on [Motorola boss countering criticism from Apple&#8217;s Jony Ive](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31511552).

> Sir Jonathan specifically asked the New Yorker magazine not to name the company he had been &#8220;scathing about&#8221;, but a campaign launched by Motorola in late 2013 matches the description he gave.
> 
> &#8220;Their value proposition was, &#8216;Make it whatever you want. You can choose whatever colour you want,'&#8221; Sir Jonathan is quoted as saying.
> 
> &#8220;And I believe that&#8217;s abdicating your responsibility as a designer.&#8221; 

Rick Osterloh, president of Motorola:

> &#8220;Our belief is that the end user should be directly involved in the process of designing products.
> 
> &#8220;We&#8217;re making the entire product line accessible.
> 
> &#8220;And frankly, we&#8217;re taking a directly opposite approach to them [Apple].&#8221;
> 
> He added that he believed this difference in strategy went wider than design.
> 
> &#8220;We do see a real dichotomy in this marketplace, where you&#8217;ve got people like Apple making so much money and charging such outrageous prices. We think that&#8217;s not the future,&#8221; he said.
> 
> &#8220;We believe the future is in offering similar experiences and great consumer choice at accessible prices. 

We only need to look at the revenue and profit figures to know which philosophy is the successful one.
