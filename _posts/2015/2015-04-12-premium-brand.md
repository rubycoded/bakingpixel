Michael Mulvey wrote on Daily Exhasut about [Ewan Spence&#8217;s Forbes piece regarding the price of the Samsung S6](http://dailyexhaust.com/2015/03/samsung-s6-pricing.html).

[Ewan Spence on Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2015/03/16/samsung-galaxy-s6-pricing-strategy/):

> Arguably the price difference could come down to Samsung running with 32 GB of storage compared to the 16 GB Apple has fitted to the iPhones, but I do like the idea of Samsung exploiting a higher price than Apple. If the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge handsets turn out to be more expensive than the Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, then Samsung will have some powerful arguments available to help sell the device. 

I&#8217;ll give you a moment to wrap your head around that.

He continued:

> Now the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge have the advantage Samsung should push hard on the specifications battle. That will be helped by Apple essentially ducking the numbers fight, so Samsung should be able to play hard on the fact that the S6 is a more powerful phone with more features.
> 
> And the easiest way to say that a phone is &#8216;better&#8217; than another phone is to be more expensive. 

Mulvey summed it up aptly:

> Premium pricing only works if your brand is perceived at premium and this perception is controlled by people who buy your products, not the company making them.
