John Gruber wrote about [NYT&#8217;s ironic dismissal of the relevance of algebra](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/12/30/algebra).

Michael Cieply, reporting for the NYT:

> “The Interview” generated roughly $15 million in online sales and rentals during its first four days of availability, Sony Pictures said on Sunday.
> 
> Sony did not say how much of that total represented $6 digital rentals versus $15 sales. The studio said there were about two million transactions over all. 

Gruber:

> Apparently, algebra is necessary for New York Times reporters and editors, because if they had a basic grasp of it, they’d understand that Sony revealed the exact split between $6 rentals and $15 sales: 1.67 million rentals ($10 million), 0.33 million sales ($5 million).
