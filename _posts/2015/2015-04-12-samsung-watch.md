CNBC reported on [Samsung executive expressing delight at Apple following them into the smartwatch market](http://www.cnbc.com/id/102575516).

> &#8220;Great competitors offer great things to consumers and the fact that there are so many great competitors in this space mean that there is absolutely a market. I mean, that&#8217;s what it tells you,&#8221; Rory O&#8217;Neill, the vice-president for mobile Europe at Samsung, which launches its S6 smartphone Friday, told CNBC.

Nice try, but those of us who have been following tech news would know that [rumours of the Apple Watch](http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/27/rumor-apple-building-bluetooth-smart-watch/) surfaced back in 2012. In response to the rumour, Samsung rushed out its first smartwatch in September 2013.

Besides, Sony and Pebble already had offerings in the smartwatch market prior to that. It is delusional for Samsung to proclaim itself as the pioneer.
