The Independent reported on [UK Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s plans to ban encrypted messaging](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatsapp-and-snapchat-could-be-banned-under-new-surveillance-plans-9973035.html).

> David Cameron could block WhatsApp and Snapchat if he wins the next election, as part of his plans for new surveillance powers announced in the wake of the shootings in Paris.
> 
> The Prime Minister said today that he would stop the use of methods of communication that cannot be read by the security services even if they have a warrant. But that could include popular chat and social apps that encrypt their data, such as WhatsApp.
> 
> Apple&#8217;s iMessage and FaceTime also encrypt their data, and could fall under the ban along with other encrypted chat apps like Telegram. 

A display of [ignorance](http://bakingpixel.com/2014/10/compromise-needed-smartphone-encryption/). If the data is accessible, it can fall into the hands of people who will misuse it. The safest place to store your data is where there are no doors at all.
