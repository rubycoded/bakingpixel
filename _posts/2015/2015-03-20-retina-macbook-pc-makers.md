BGR reported on [PC makers mocking Apple&#8217;s Retina MacBook](http://bgr.com/2015/03/13/apple-retina-macbook-pc-makers/).

The Asus is 6.1% thinner and the Lenovo is 2.3% thinner. Of course, it is hard for Asus or Lenovo to impress us with the minute difference in thinnest, so they need to shamelessly resort to misleading graphics.

And as [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/03/18/pc-makers-new-macbook) pointed out, none of the PC makers mentioned anything about the trackpad. PC track pads have never reached the precision of Apple&#8217;s old trackpad. And now Apple has raised the bar further with the Force Touch trackpad.
