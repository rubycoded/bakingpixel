> South Korean smartphone giant Samsung paid people to pretend to be its fans at a press conference for its products’ release on Friday, reports Shanghai-based news outlet the Paper.
> 
> A person specializing in recruiting these “fans” said he brought over 100 people to the event. They and the other groups of people brought by other recruiters reached 400 to 500 in total. These hired “fans” amounted to around half of the 1,000 people at the event, according to the Paper. 

They had to hire people to fill half the event.

> The smartphone brand has also hired several groups of 20 to 30 people to be its professional fans. A woman surnamed Huang who joined one of the groups said she applied for the job after seeing a recruitment ad in a group chat on popular messaging app WeChat. Every hired person is required to post their picture, register their name and phone number and like the fan page of Samsung Galaxy on Baidu’s online forum Baidu Tieba. A Samsung staff member who also joined the group chat checks and monitors the application process. 

They did not just buy their attendance, but likes on the fan page as well.

> The recruiters told them to tell reporters they were at the event because they are Samsung&#8217;s fans or interested in the smartphone brand&#8217;s new model the S6, said the paper. Over half of the people taking photos of Samsung&#8217;s latest model the S6 and the S6 Edge were using iPhones. One of them told the news outlet that she went to the event after reading a post on microblog, saying that Samsung offers secret gifts for attendees. 

But apparently these &#8220;Samsung fans&#8221; are iPhone users.
