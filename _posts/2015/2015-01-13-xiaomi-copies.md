BGR reported about [Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun warning people not to buy Xiaomi products](http://bgr.com/2015/01/12/xiaomi-knockoff-devices-china/).

> Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi has been on a tear lately, although when you look at some of its devices, you quickly notice that they bear a striking resemblance to devices released by Apple. This is why we find it amusing that Xiaomiâ€™s CEO is now warning its fans to watch out for knockoff Xiaomi products being sold at phone retail outlets in Chinese cities. 

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
