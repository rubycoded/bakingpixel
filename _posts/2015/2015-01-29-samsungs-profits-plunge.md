AppleInsider reported on [Samsung&#8217;s mobile profits plunging 64.2%](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/01/28/samsungs-mobile-profits-plunge-642-after-apples-iphone-6-devastates-premium-galaxy-sales).

> Samsung Electronics reported overall Q4 operating profits of 5.29 trillion won ($4.9 billion)—a 36 percent year-over-year drop—but its Mobile division suffered a 64.2 percent drop in profits, falling from $5 billion in the year ago quarter to $1.8 billion in the December quarter. 

How does that affect Samsung as a whole?

> At the beginning of 2014, Samsung IM was contributing 70 percent of the company&#8217;s profits, primarily from smartphone sales, specifically from sales of its higher end Galaxy S and Note devices. Mobile division sales, which also include Samsung&#8217;s Chromebooks, Windows products and Galaxy Tab tablets, currently account for only 37 percent of the company&#8217;s profits. 

How does that compare to Apple&#8217;s profits?

> Apple&#8217;s overall operating profits for the quarter were $24.2 billion, up 36.9 percent over the year ago quarter. That means Samsung Mobile is now earning less than 7.5 percent of Apple&#8217;s profits while still shipping more phone units.
