The Verge reported on [Twitch ditching Flash and switching to HTML5](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/23/9019973/twitch-dropping-flash-controls-for-html5).

> The streaming service today announced that it was rolling out a redesign to its video player controls, replacing the old Flash versions with new Javascipt and HTML5 options. This isn&#8217;t the end for Flash on Twitch just yet — for now the site&#8217;s videos still use the software — but the streaming service says this is a step toward releasing its &#8220;much-anticipated&#8221; full HTML5 player. 

Winds of change.
