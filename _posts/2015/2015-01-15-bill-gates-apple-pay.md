CNET reported on [Bill Gates heaping praise on Apple Pay](http://www.cnet.com/news/bill-gates-apple-pay-is-fantastic/).

> Gates, though, said that Apple&#8217;s true role was in creating the market: &#8220;All the platforms, whether it&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s or Google&#8217;s or Microsoft, you&#8217;ll see this payment capability get built in. That&#8217;s built on industry standard protocols, NFC. And these companies have all participated in getting those going. Apple will help make sure it gets to critical mass for all the devices.&#8221;

> Competitors realize that once Apple gets involved in a certain idea, there&#8217;s more of a chance for everyone.

> Apple has two advantages. It has a vast number of high-worth individuals in its ecosystem. It also has a talent for making its devices simple to use. 

He had the idea years ago but was unable to push it through. Kudos to Gates for having the humility to recognise Apple&#8217;s accomplishments in rolling out Apple Pay.
