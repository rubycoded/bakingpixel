Ars Technica reported on [how the NSA and allies exploited Google and Samsung&#8217;s app stores](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/theres-an-app-for-that-how-nsa-allies-exploit-mobile-app-stores/).

> In 2011 and 2012, the NSA and the communications intelligence agencies of its &#8220;Five Eyes&#8221; allies developed and tested a set of add-ons to their shared Internet surveillance capability that could identify and target communications between mobile devices and popular mobile app storesâ€”including those of Google and Samsung. According to an NSA document published by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the targeting capability could have been used to launch &#8220;man-in-the-middle&#8221; attacks on mobile app downloads, allowing the NSA and other agencies to install code on targeted devices and gather intelligence on their users. 

Apple&#8217;s App Store is conspicuously missing.
