[Pebble](https://getpebble.com/) launched a new branding campaign but shoots themselves in the foot by taking a swipe at Jony Ive.

I have to agree with [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/09/30/pebble):

> What gives me pause, though, is the “Breathe, Jony” headline. That seems a little petty. Personal, not playful.
