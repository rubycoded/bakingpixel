The Guardian reports that [Google is bringing its Street View indoors](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/27/google-street-view-airports-stations).

> Google has added 16 international airports and 59 train and subway stations to Street View, including a number of British locations.
> 
> They include Gatwick Airport and train stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds, as well as a (nearly) full set of London mainline stations: Paddington, Victoria, King&#8217;s Cross, St. Pancras, Charing Cross, Waterloo, London Bridge, Cannon Street, Fenchurch Street and Liverpool Street. 

It was never a matter of whether Google would do this, but simply when it would.
