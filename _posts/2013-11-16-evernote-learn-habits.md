Mashable reports how [Evernote will be able to learn your habits in the future](http://mashable.com/2013/11/14/whats-next-for-evernote/).

> For Evernote, utilizing this data means teaching the app how to learn the habits of its users. For example, if a user has her weekly project meeting on the calendar each Tuesday, Evernote should be able to surface her meeting notes for her, or even prepare a blank note in preparation for the meeting without any work from the user.
> 
> “We want to make Evernote better at reorganizing itself to suit the way that you use it,” he says. “To wrap itself around your brain.” 

This is something all apps should strive towards. Having an app that knows my habit well will make it very hard for me to want to switch to a different app. This will be great for user retention.
