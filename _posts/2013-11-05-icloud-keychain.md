Jon Brodkin gives a good [overview of iCloud Keychain](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/apples-icloud-keychain-it-works-but-its-limitations-are-frustrating/).

It is a very good read to understand the function, and limitations, of iCloud Keychain. However, Brodkin needs to manage his expectations. You get what you paid for.

> But in almost every other way, iCloud Keychain falls short of the functionality one expects from a paid password manager. 

I think this is precisely what iCloud Keychain is built for: users who don&#8217;t have a password manager or refuse to pay for one.

> iCloud Keychain is indeed a useful addition to OS X and iOS, especially for people who use Safari across both operating systems. On iOS, iCloud Keychain fills the chief gap in third-party password managersâ€”the lack of integration with Safari. For something that comes free with the operating system, that&#8217;s a nice feature. Combined with the automatic password generator (despite its non-customizability), iCloud Keychain can help people who don&#8217;t already use a password manager improve their defenses against hackers.
