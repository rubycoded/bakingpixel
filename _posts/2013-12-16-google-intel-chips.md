The Verge reports that [Google might be designing its own processor chips](http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/13/5206420/google-arm-chips-for-servers-rumor).

Seems like Google is learning the importance of being in control of the production processor chip. Apple has control over the its chip architecture and iOS structure, hence it is able to optimise hardware and software for best performance.
