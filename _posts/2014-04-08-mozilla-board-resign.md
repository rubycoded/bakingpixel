WSJ Digits reports on [the resignation of three Mozilla board members over choice of new CEO](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/03/28/three-mozilla-board-members-resign-over-choice-of-new-ceo/).

How did the CEO appointment go ahead when three board members, who felt so strongly against it that they are willing to quit over it, and [Mozilla employees](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/28/after-supporting-prop-8-brendan-eich-comes-under-fire-from-mozilla-employees-upon-ceo-appointment/) oppose the decision?

I canâ€™t even begin to imagine how messed up their decision making process is.
