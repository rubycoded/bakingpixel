Despite [Samsung](http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/31/5050084/lg-samsung-curved-smartphone-design-flexible-oled-future) and [LG](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/lg-shows-off-the-bend-in-its-flex/?_r=0) recently introducing phones with curved displays, I remain highly doubtful that Apple will introduce an iPhone with a curved display anytime soon, if ever. Aside from showcasing the technology for curved displays, there still isn&#8217;t any real practical use for a curved phone. A curved display would make much more sense on a wearable device, though.

The continued rumor of a larger iPhone, possibly with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays is also welcome and continues to gain traction.

[Apple Said Developing Curved iPhone Screens, Enhanced Sensors](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-10/apple-said-developing-curved-iphone-screens-enhanced-sensors.html)

> Apple Inc. (AAPL) is developing new iPhone designs including bigger screens with curved glass and enhanced sensors that can detect different levels of pressure, said a person familiar with the plans.  
> Two models planned for release in the second half of next year will feature larger displays with glass that curves downward at the edges, said the person, declining to be identified as the details arenâ€™t public. Sensors that can distinguish heavy or light touches on the screen may be incorporated into subsequent models, the person said.
