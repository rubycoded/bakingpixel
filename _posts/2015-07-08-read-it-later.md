The folks over at [The Sweet Setup](http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-read-it-later-service/) have done a nice review of the current crop of Read It Later services. If you&#8217;re just getting into the act of saving articles for offline reading, it&#8217;s a good place to start.

> But even more importantly, you don’t always have time to read an article the first moment you come across it. Ideally, you could have a place to store those articles for later when you actually have the time to curl up on that couch. Depending on the website, reading on the web can often be a hostile experience with distracting ads, over-pagination, requests to sign up for newsletters, and spammy “promoted stories from around the web” cluttering up your reading and making you question the moral fabric of human civilization.

> Read-it-later services can solve all of these problems, helping you save articles to read on your preferred device in a much friendlier, more beautiful format. You could think of these services like Tivo for the Internet. As you browse the web during the day, you can pick and choose the things you want to read, and at night, instead of continuing to browse, you have a hand-picked selection of great material ready for you to read. 

My first encounter with these apps was with [Marco Arment&#8217;s](http://www.marco.org) [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com), which I loved to bits. Eventually I moved to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) and stayed there till today. Deciding on which one to use is really more a matter of preference, so go ahead and try whichever one you please.
