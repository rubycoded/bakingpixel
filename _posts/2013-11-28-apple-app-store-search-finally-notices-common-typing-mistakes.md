To me, search has always been one of Apple&#8217;s weak points. Even after taking that into account, it&#8217;s always been frustrating that mistyping one letter could mean that you would not find the app that you&#8217;re looking for. This is a small step in the right direction, and hopefully search improvements come to Apple Maps too.

> Though misspellings may represent the long tail of App Store searches, correcting for these queries is an important feature for any search engine to offer, whether app search or otherwise. However, it&#8217;s clear that in search, as expected, Google has had the advantage here – it&#8217;s nearly 2014, and only now has Apple made this sort of basic feature live.
