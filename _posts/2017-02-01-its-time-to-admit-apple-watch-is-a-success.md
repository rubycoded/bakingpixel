> One of the hits on Apple Watch is that Apple doesn&#8217;t break out numbers for the product the way they do for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Many companies provide no numbers on any products, Amazon being a prime example. Yet that hasn&#8217;t prevented the very same tech community from pushing a very different narrative around Echo. 

Double standards when it comes to Apple.

> Yet, the narrative around Apple Watch was so lost that when Google delayed Android Wear 2, vendors like Motorola/Lenovo exited the market, and Pebble sold itself off, hot takes tripped over each other claiming the &#8220;smartwatch market&#8221; might be dead. 

This is similar to the tablet market.

> It could be that there is no real &#8220;Smartwatch market&#8221;, just an Apple Watch market. Much like there&#8217;s no real &#8220;tablet market&#8221;, just an iPad market. Since it&#8217;s such a new product category and most of the existing products are still bound to phones, it could also simply be too soon to tell. 

Perhaps there isn&#8217;t a smartwatch market and Apple is now firmly in the watch market.
