Nintendo has given us a [first look at the Nintendo Switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5uik5fgIaI), and it&#8217;s a pretty daring departure from the current form of consoles we&#8217;re used to.

Not too surprising though, as Nintendo isn&#8217;t afraid to try new things, as evidenced with the Wii. I&#8217;m looking forward to checking this out, though I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll give a proper challenge to the Playstation or Xbox anytime soon.
