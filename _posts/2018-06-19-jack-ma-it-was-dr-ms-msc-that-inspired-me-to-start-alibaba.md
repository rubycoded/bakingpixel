The Star reported that [it was Dr Mahathir&#8217;s MSC that inspired Jack Ma to start Alibaba](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/06/18/jack-ma-inspiration-to-form-alibaba-came-from-dr-m-msc/).

> The Alibaba founder and executive chairman said that he read about MSC in a newspaper 20 years ago and found the idea inspiring.
> 
> &#8220;I thought, &#8216;Wow, this is a genius idea. If Malaysia can do this, why can&#8217;t China. Why can&#8217;t I do this myself?&#8217;
> 
> &#8220;So Malaysia inspired me to create Alibaba,&#8221; he said during the launch of an Alibaba Group office in Kuala Lumpur on Monday (June 18). 

20 years later, the divide is stark. Malaysia has sadly lagged behind.
