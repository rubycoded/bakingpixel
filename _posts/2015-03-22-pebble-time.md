Apple World Today reported on [why Pebble Time is not a serious Apple Watch competitor](http://www.appleworld.today/blog/2015/3/16/the-pebble-time-is-not-serious-apple-watch-competition).

> A much nicer display: Pebble says the new Time will have a &#8220;&#8230;1.25-inch color e-paper display&#8221;. No word on the resolution of that display. Apple Watch will have a Retina display (meaning 300 pixels or more per inch).
> 
> A Force Touch interface: Pebble is all about the side buttons. Watch has a button and the digital crown, but the innovative Force Touch display is a primary interface element.
> 
> Support: AppleCare Pro and local Apple Stores should provide both live technical support and the ability to take the Watch directly into stores for replacement or repair. Pebble offers a one-year warranty and a good website, but dropping your ailing Pebble Time into a shipping box is no substitute for being able to actually talk to a real live person or hand a broken Watch to someone at a store near you.
> 
> Integration: Apple Watch apps are being created by a number of iOS developers, which means that it&#8217;s very likely that many of the top iOS apps will feature tighter integration with Watch than they&#8217;d ever be able to achieve with Pebble. Want to send an email, Message, or voice reply on your Watch? No problem. Try to do the same with Pebble and you&#8217;re limited to providing a voice reply to Google notifications.
> 
> HealthKit: Yes, Pebble Time has &#8220;step tracking for Misfit and Jawbone&#8221;, a RunTracker companion app. Apple Watch will have integration with the entire HealthKit framework through the iPhone, a heart rate sensor to measure the intensity of your activity, the ability to watch just how much you&#8217;re moving (or not), an Activity app (with iPhone counterpart in the Watch app), and probably integration with most major fitness apps within a short time of launch.
> 
> HomeKit: Expect your Apple Watch to have deep integration with the HomeKit home automation framework as well. Tap the Watch to lock or unlock a door, turn off lights? Sure &#8211; it&#8217;s not here yet, but soon.
> 
> A real app store: The Pebble Smartwatch App provides a way to browse and discover apps for the Pebble. Most of those appear to be watch faces. While I assume that watch faces will be a fun item on the Watch as well, we&#8217;ll see vetted apps with a tried and true delivery and update system. 

Enough said.
