PCWorld reported that [Google has finally promised to fix a battery bug in its Chrome browser](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2455442/chromes-been-eating-your-laptops-battery-for-years-but-google-promises-to-fix-it.html).

> This bug wouldn&#8217;t be too surprising if it was introduced in a recent update. But according to Morris, the first report of it popped up in 2010, and a more recent bug report in Chromium has been racking up new comments since November 2012. So if your Windows laptop isn&#8217;t getting the battery life you&#8217;d expected, it&#8217;s possible that Chrome is the culprit. 

This comes a few days after a [Forbes report](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ianmorris/2014/07/14/googles-chrome-web-browser-is-killing-your-laptop-battery/) highlighted the issue.

A few years versus a few days.
