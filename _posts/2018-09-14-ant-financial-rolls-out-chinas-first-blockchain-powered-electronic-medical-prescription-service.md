TechNode reported that [Ant Financial has rolled out China&#8217;s first blockchain-powered electronic medical prescription service](https://technode.com/2018/09/13/ant-financial-first-blockchain-medical-prescription/).

> Ant Financial and Huashan Hospital, a teaching hospital affiliated to Fudan University in Shanghai, have launched what is said to be the first blockchain-powered electronic medical prescription service in China, local media is reporting (in Chinese).
> 
> The new medical prescription platform, which can be accessed via the Huashan Hospital mini program in the Alipay app, keeps track of all records incurred the prescription process–from filing the prescription, dispensing the medication to delivering the medication to the patient’s hands–using blockchain technology. All records and information are traceable and cannot be tampered with.
> 
> The Huashan Hospital is the first hospital in the country to integrate this service. As of now, the new blockchain prescription service is only adopted by the department of endocrinology, however, if successful, it will be adopted hospital-wide, according to Zhang Qi, the deputy director of the IT department of the hospital. 

Interesting use of blockchain.
