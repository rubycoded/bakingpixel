Steve Kovach of Business Insider [reviews the Nexus 5](http://www.businessinsider.com/nexus-5-review-2013-11).

> Either way, the Nexus 5 is the perfect device if you want to make sure you always have the best Google has to offer with Android. It might not be much to look at, but it&#8217;s the best device you can own if you care about the experience and Google ecosystem above anything else. 

Using Android the way Google intended it to be.
