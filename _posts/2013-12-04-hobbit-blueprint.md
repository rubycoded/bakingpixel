The Verge reports that fans can [download the 3D blueprint of the Key of Erebor, an artefact from _The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug_](http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/3/5171406/new-hobbit-ad-campaign-lets-viewers-download-a-3d-blueprint) and make a replica using a 3D printer.

> While the ads offer standard fare like links to buy tickets and check out movie trailers, there&#8217;s one particularly clever component to the campaign — viewers will be able to download 3D-printing blueprints for the Key of Erebor, a prop that should feature prominently in the second part of the Hobbit film trilogy.
