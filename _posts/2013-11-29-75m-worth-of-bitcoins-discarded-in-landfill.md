If you&#8217;re storing some Bitcoins around, it&#8217;s best to ensure that they&#8217;re stored properly. Those 7,500 Bitcoins would translate to about $7,500,000 when the crytocurrency [reached $1,000 recently](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/bitcoin-value-reaches-1000/).

> &#8220;You know when you put something in the bin, and in your head, say to yourself &#8216;that&#8217;s a bad idea&#8217;? I really did have that,&#8221; Howells, who works in IT, told the Guardian. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have an exact date, the only time period I can give – and I&#8217;ve been racking my own brains – is between 20 June and 10 August. Probably mid-July&#8221;. At the time he obliviously threw them away, the 7,500 Bitcoins on the hard-drive were worth around £500,000. Since then, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value has soared, passing $1,000 on Wednesday afternoon.
