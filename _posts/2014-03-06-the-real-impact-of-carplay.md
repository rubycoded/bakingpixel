Macworld reports on [the real impact of CarPlay—software](http://www.macworld.com/article/2104242/the-real-impact-of-carplay-its-the-software-dummy.html).

> Most people probably don’t ever think about the software in their car. And with good reason, too, since most automakers aren’t exactly consumed with a passion for developing software. Even in the cases where car companies do want to pimp the software features, the spotlight’s always going to be on the newest model—they don’t have too much interest in continuing to update the software on older models, especially when it comes to adding new features.
