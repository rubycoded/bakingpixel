For a great example of this, read Ben Kuchera&#8217;s [&#8220;Skeptical of HoloLens? It&#8217;s time to rewatch how Microsoft sold us on the Kinect&#8221;](http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/21/7868351/hololens-kinect-microsoft-windows-10).

Or at least can&#8217;t deliver for another five years? Why are you getting people excited? It&#8217;s a wonderful future you&#8217;ve got painted here, but we&#8217;ve seen this show before. You need to stop this behavior Microsoft, because isn&#8217;t helping, and I know it sounds odd coming from me, but I really do want your products to kick ass.

When Apple gives demos of their new product, they aren&#8217;t throwing in CG showing how they hope things will happen some day in the future. Instead they show the real deal. How it&#8217;s being used yesterday. And it&#8217;s those possibilities that get us excited. And Apple frames it so well. The product demos never show us at work (because who wants to get excited about work?), instead the demos show us how the product will be used in our life. How it can make the things we enjoy even better.

Something competitors need to learn to get consumers excited when they announce new products.
