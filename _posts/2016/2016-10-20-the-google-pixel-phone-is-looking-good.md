> If you’re an Android fan, willing to buy a premium phone, the Pixel is your answer. To repeat: it’s simply the best Android phone I’ve tested. If you’re an iPhone user thinking of switching, the Pixel will seem physically familiar, but you’ll have to overcome the sticky links you’ve developed with fellow iPhone users, things like iMessage (which Google can’t match yet) and iCloud Photo Sharing (which Google is trying to copy). You’ll also have to do without the comfort of your neighborhood Genius Bar.

While I&#8217;m not bothered about any digital assistants, including Siri or Google Assistant, I am really intrigued how Google plans to manage and enforce the [unlimited full resolution photo storage for pictures taken with the Pixel](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/04/googles-pixel-smartphones-come-with-free-storage-for-full-res-photos-and-videos/). It&#8217;s a great selling point of the phone, and hits Apple where it hurts &#8211; the shameful 5GB of free iCloud storage that we&#8217;re still being offered.
