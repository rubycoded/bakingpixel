Larry Dignan reported on ZDNet about [Why Samsung&#8217;s Harman purchase will be seen as Apple blunder decades from now](http://www.zdnet.com/article/why-samsungs-harman-purchase-will-be-seen-as-apple-blunder-decades-from-now/).

> Samsung&#8217;s purchase of Harman is strategically sound, worth the $8 billion, and positions Samsung well in the connected car market. Meanwhile, Samsung diversifies from a saturated smartphone market. 

How is diversification good if Samsung&#8217;s whole operations as a conglomerate is all about diversifying into all industries that make money?

If you&#8217;re not familiar with Samsung&#8217;s operations, check [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung#Operations).

Samsung is in many markets making low margin for the purpose of making money. Apple is in the smartphone market making high margin because their purpose is to make the best smartphone. Likewise for the desktop and laptop markets.
