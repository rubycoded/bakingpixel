> The Pixel charges via USB-C, and uses USB-PD (Power Direct) to pull a whopping 7 hours of battery life in fifteen minutes from its 18W charger when starting with a near-dead smartphone. (USB-PD, like most quick-charging solutions, scales down the power draw depending on how badly your smartphone is hurting for battery life.) Combine that with the Pixel&#8217;s 2770mAh battery, and Google&#8217;s smartphone is not only going to last longer, but come back from the dead much more quickly than either of Apple&#8217;s smartphone options.

> The thing is, Apple has quick-charge technology in the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and its various mobile accessories; the company is also no stranger to USB-C, having used it in the MacBook. It may not have been feasible to stick that kind of quick-charging into the iPhone 7 given time and resource constraints, but that only makes me more greedy for it in next year&#8217;s iPhone. The age of slow-charge batteries is coming to a close, and I can only hope that Google is heralding the call. 

Serenity Caldwell wrote a [good piece](http://www.imore.com/five-things-apple-can-learn-from-made-by-google-event) on the #MadeByGoogle event, but while I wasn&#8217;t too bothered about the camera on the Pixel, I really wish that proper quick charging would be implemented on the iPhone.
