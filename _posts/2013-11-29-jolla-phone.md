BBC reports that former Nokia employees have [launched Jolla, a smartphone powered by open-source operating system Sailfish](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25120727).

> The platform &#8211; originally called MeeGo &#8211; was developed by Nokia, but dumped in 2011 in favour of the company adopting the Windows Phone system.
> 
> Nokia released just one handset running the software, the N9-00.
> 
> Antti Saarnio, chairman and co-founder of Jolla, told the BBC in May that MeeGo &#8211; now called Sailfish &#8211; had not been given enough chance to succeed. 

The company wants to provide consumers with a more open operating system. Jolla phone is able to run Android apps. It remains to be seen if it will eventually support apps built for other platforms.

> The phone&#8217;s ethos was to provide a more &#8220;open&#8221; approach to how people used their mobiles, a contrast to the relatively closed systems used on the iPhone and, to a lesser extent, Android devices.
> 
> &#8220;There&#8217;s different opportunities for people to get apps form different places, different stores,&#8221; he said.
