The Next Web reports that [Path has added a feature that allows users to post moments from its Android app to their WordPress blogs](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/12/08/path-android-now-lets-share-moments-wordpress-blogs/).

I hope this comes to iOS soon. While Android is on Path 3.2.4, iOS is still on version 3.2.2.
