Ars Technica reports about [the Nexus 5’s “exclusive” launcher being available on other Android devices through a workaround](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/11/the-nexus-5s-exclusive-launcher-suspiciously-receives-support-for-other-devices/).

> Late yesterday, a new version of Google Search hit the Play Store for everyone running Android 4.1 and higher—Google Search version 3.1. All the Google Home code was completely intact, meaning that Google just shipped its new launcher out to every modern Android phone. In order for Google Home to work, it requires a tiny enabler app that comes with the Nexus 5. The enabler app isn’t being shipped out to these other devices, so while 99 percent of the code is now on everyone’s device (or it will be when the rollout finishes), it’s disabled. 

Why include the code but not enable the function?
