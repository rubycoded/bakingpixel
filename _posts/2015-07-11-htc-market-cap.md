Ars Technica reported on [how standing still caused HTC to lose half of its market cap in four months](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/help-this-company-a-post-mortem-of-htcs-horrible-start-to-2015/).

> Have you heard about HTC lately? 2015 is shaping up to be an awful year for the company. In March the company had a market cap of $4.06 billion, and today—only a few months later—it&#8217;s worth less than half of that. The stock price, at about two bucks a share, is at a 10-year low. HTC just wrapped up the second quarter of 2015, where it posted a net loss of $258 million. And the trend is downwards—year over year, HTC&#8217;s monthly revenue was down 38% in April, 48% in May, and 60% in June. Will July be even worse? HTC is back to being that struggling OEM that feels like it could be permanently knocked out of the race at any time. There&#8217;s even been talk of the company being acquired. 

The race to the bottom is always ugly.
