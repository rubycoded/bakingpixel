Businessweek recounts [the rise and fall of BlackBerry](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-05/the-rise-and-fall-of-blackberry-an-oral-history).

> One thing we missed out on was that Justin Bieber wanted to rep BlackBerry. He said, “Give me $200,000 and 20 devices, and I’m your brand ambassador,” basically. And we pitched that to marketing: Here’s a Canadian kid, he grew up here, all the teeny-boppers will love that. They basically threw us out of the room. They said, “This kid is a fad. He’s not going to last.” I said at the meeting: “This kid might outlive RIM.” Everyone laughed. 

That was a golden opportunity to reach out to the younger generation.
