The issue of patent trolls has been around for a long time, and many companies have been on the [receiving end](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/newegg-loses-a-patent-dispute-ordered-to-pay-2-3-million/) of litigation from patent trolls that want to make a quick buck.

One of the major challenges when dealing with patent trolls is that defending your position also costs money, which isn&#8217;t something that every startup can afford. Hopefully with new legislation, the issue of patent trolls can be reduced, if not eliminated.
