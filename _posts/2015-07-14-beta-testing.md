Federico Viticci wrote on MacStories about how [apps are getting negative reviews in the App Store for issues with beta versions of iOS and OS X](http://www.macstories.net/stories/on-negative-app-store-reviews-during-betas-of-ios-and-os-x/).

> The frustration of the tweets embedded above generates from the fact that some users are leaving negative App Store reviews pointing out problems with running apps on beta versions of iOS and OS X. Some of those users may not know this (and understandably so, it&#8217;s not their responsibility to know), but App Store reviews are important to developers. It is widely believed that positive reviews affect the ranking and visibility of an app on the App Store, but, perhaps more importantly, reviews are, for customers, the primary way of knowing whether an app is worth downloading or not. An app with several 1-star reviews? Probably not worth installing for many. 

People who want to be involved in beta testing should have some basic knowledge of how to handle the issues that arises, especially from version incompatibilities.
