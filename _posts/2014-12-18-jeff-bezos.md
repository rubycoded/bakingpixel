Jennifer Saba wrote on Reuters about [Jeff Bezos defending Amazon&#8217;s lack of profits and the company&#8217;s stance on publishers](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/02/us-amazon-com-bezos-idUSKCN0JG29M20141202).

> His comments come a day after Moody&#8217;s Investors Service downgraded its outlook on Amazon to &#8220;negative,&#8221; citing the company&#8217;s upcoming debt offering and the &#8220;lack of visibility&#8221; about how the funds would be deployed.
> 
> Investors have grown increasingly unhappy about Amazon&#8217;s spending and lack of disclosure about future plans. Its shares have fallen more than 18 percent this year, despite a 14 percent rise in the Nasdaq. 

You would expect a big company like Amazon to be accountable to investors.

> Bezos, relaxed in jeans and a gray jacket, defended Amazon&#8217;s culture as one willing to spend on new projects, even if they flop like its poor-selling Fire phone.
> 
> &#8220;We are a large company, but we are also still a start-up. There is a lot of volatility in start-ups,&#8221; Bezos said at a conference organized by the Business Insider blog in New York. 

I think I have talked enough about the [Fire](http://bakingpixel.com/2014/07/amazon-fire-phone-review/) [Phone](http://bakingpixel.com/2014/07/another-amazon-fire-phone-review/). The investors are probably glad to know that they are investing in a start-up.

> Publishers are in better shape because of e-books, which became popular after Amazon launched the Kindle e-reader in 2007, he said, adding that books are still too expensive.
> 
> &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to embrace change,&#8221; Bezos said. &#8220;Making reading more affordable is not going to make authors less money. &#8230; It&#8217;s going to make authors more money.&#8221; 

How is commoditisation of creative work a good thing for writers? Bezos shows a lack of appreciation for writing with his statement.

[Ursula Le Guin](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/national-book-awards-ursula-le-guin) puts it aptly:

> I think hard times are coming, when we will be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now, and can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies, to other ways of being. And even imagine some real grounds for hope. We will need writers who can remember freedom: poets, visionaries—the realists of a larger reality. Right now, I think we need writers who know the difference between production of a market commodity and the practice of an art. The profit motive is often in conflict with the aims of art. We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable; so did the divine right of kings. … Power can be resisted and changed by human beings; resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art—the art of words. I’ve had a long career and a good one, in good company, and here, at the end of it, I really don’t want to watch American literature get sold down the river. … The name of our beautiful reward is not profit. Its name is freedom.
