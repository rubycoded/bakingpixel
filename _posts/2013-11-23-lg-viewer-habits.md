A user claims that his [LG Smart TV is sending his viewing information to LG](http://doctorbeet.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/lg-smart-tvs-logging-usb-filenames-and.html).

He found an LG video pitching to potential advertisers:

> LG Smart Ad analyses users favourite programs, online behaviour, search keywords and other information to offer relevant ads to target audiences. For example, LG Smart Ad can feature sharp suits to men, or alluring cosmetics and fragrances to women.
> 
> Furthermore, LG Smart Ad offers useful and various advertising performance reports. That live broadcasting ads cannot. To accurately identify actual advertising effectiveness. 

The TV settings has an option to turn “Collection of watching info” ON or OFF. But he found that the data was still transmitted regardless of the setting.

When he asked LG for comments about it, the company directed him to the retailer he bought the TV from instead:

> The advice we have been given is that unfortunately as you accepted the Terms and Conditions on your TV, your concerns would be best directed to the retailer. We understand you feel you should have been made aware of these T&#8217;s and C&#8217;s at the point of sale, and for obvious reasons LG are unable to pass comment on their actions.
