The Verge writes about [Facebook’s Slingshot app](http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/17/5817996/facebook-slingshot-app-vs-snapchat).

> In Snapchat or any other messaging app, you can view a message as soon as you receive it. But in Slingshot, you can’t view an incoming “shot” until you send a shot back to the sender. “It’s not just about telling your story, it’s about asking others for their story,” says Slingshot designer Joey Flynn. In other words, Slingshot makes you trade a photo of what you’re doing before you can “unlock” the picture of whatever your friend is up to. Huh?

> The &#8220;pay to play&#8221; mechanic is difficult to wrap your head around. It’s frustrating, not exciting when a friend sends you a shot and you can’t immediately view it. Slingshot is a new and strange example of a messaging app that raises barriers instead of tearing them down, and increases the friction to viewing a friend’s photo instead of reducing it. 

Before you get to see what I sent you, you need to send something back. This is as bad as forcing me to watch an ad before I get to the content I want.
