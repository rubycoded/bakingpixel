MacRumours reports that [Apple is recognising World AIDS Dayin its retail stores and on its website](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/11/30/apple-once-again-recognizes-world-aids-day-in-store-and-online/).

> Every day, 900 babies are born with HIV. (RED) works with companies like Apple to fight for an AIDS‑free generation by creating (PRODUCT)RED merchandise. A percentage of gross profits from the sale of those products goes to the Global Fund to help fund AIDS programmes in Africa. Since its introduction, (PRODUCT)RED has generated more than $215 million for the Global Fund — more than $65 million from Apple alone. You can help make an impact by purchasing a (PRODUCT)RED iPod or (PRODUCT)RED accessories for iPhone and iPad.
