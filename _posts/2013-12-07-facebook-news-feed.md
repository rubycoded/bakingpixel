Digital Trends reports that [Facebook&#8217;s new News Feed will give priority to quality posts](http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-announces-new-news-feed/).

> “Starting soon, we’ll be doing a better job of distinguishing between a high quality article on a website versus a meme photo hosted somewhere other than Facebook when people click on those stories,” Facebook says. ”This means that high quality articles you or others read may show up a bit more prominently in your News Feed, and meme photos may show up a bit less prominently.” 

Some memes generate more social engagements than a long article, and they might convey a more powerful message too.
