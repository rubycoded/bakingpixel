Quartz reported that [Google collects Android users&#8217; locations even when location services are disabled](https://qz.com/1131515/google-collects-android-users-locations-even-when-location-services-are-disabled/).

> Since the beginning of 2017, Android phones have been collecting the addresses of nearby cellular towers—even when location services are disabled—and sending that data back to Google. The result is that Google, the unit of Alphabet behind Android, has access to data about individuals’ locations and their movements that go far beyond a reasonable consumer expectation of privacy.
> 
> Quartz observed the data collection occur and contacted Google, which confirmed the practice.
> 
> The cell tower addresses have been included in information sent to the system Google uses to manage push notifications and messages on Android phones for the past 11 months, according to a Google spokesperson. They were never used or stored, the spokesperson said, and the company is now taking steps to end the practice after being contacted by Quartz. By the end of November, the company said, Android phones will no longer send cell-tower location data to Google, at least as part of this particular service, which consumers cannot disable. 

When Apple collected location data _locally_ on the phone, there was a big outcry by the media over it. Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s the response regarding Google _collecting_ the data.
