WSJ.com reports that [the US House of Representatives has passed a bill targeting patent trolls](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303497804579240283237807474).

> The House adopted an amendment from Rep. Jared Polis (D., Colo.) that would require patent holders to disclose their ultimate parent entity when filing lawsuits, to prevent them from hiding behind shell companies. It also approved an amendment from Mr. Rohrabacher that would preserve companies&#8217; ability to appeal the decisions of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in U.S. district courts. 

Opponents of the amendment, including [IBM and Microsoft](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/patent-reform-ibm-microsoft/) argue that the reform discourages innovation.
