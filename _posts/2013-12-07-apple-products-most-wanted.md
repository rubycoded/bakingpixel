Parks Associates announced [a research showing that Apple topped the list of purchase intentions for multiple categories](http://www.parksassociates.com/blog/article/pr-dec2013-brands).

Apple was the number one brand for desktops and tablets, and its Apple TV was the top streaming media device. Apple replaces Dell as the most wanted desktop brand.

> “Apple topped the list of intended brands for desktop purchases for the first time this year,” said John Barrett, director, Consumer Analytics, Parks Associates. “In 2011 and 2012, Dell was the top desktop brand, but Apple has displaced it, making Apple now the most popular brand across even more key CE categories.”
