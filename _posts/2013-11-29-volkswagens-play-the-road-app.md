WIRED.com reports on [Volkswagen’s Play the Road app](http://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/11/volkswagen-play-the-road/) that tailors music to your driving.

> To begin with, VW’s boffins enlisted the help of the legendary sonic duo Underworld to help create the sounds, synths, and rhythms to create an ever-evolving soundtrack. Then they used an iPhone’s accelerometer and gyroscope to track the GTI’s maneuvers, followed by cross-referencing it with onboard video and GPS of exactly what the car was doing on the track. After that, they tethered the phone to the car’s on-board computer to get speed and engine revs, then ported it all to the Pure Data musical programming language that creates live sound.
