TechNode reported that [operations of Apple&#8217;s iCloud services in China are about to be transferred to a company in Guizhou](http://technode.com/2018/01/10/apple-icloud-guizhou/).

> In November,Â Apple has been accused of relying on students working illegal overtime to build the iPhone X, through Foxconn, which manufactures the devices in Zhengzhou. 

This is completely unrelated to the transfer of iCloud&#8217;s service but the author chose to plug it at the end of the article to bait clicks.
