RazorianFly writing on [the entitlement mentality](http://razorianfly.com/2015/01/14/the-entitlement-mentality/).

> &#8220;I think that entitlement mentality is what has killed these promotions. Getting free stuff is no longer enough. It must be exactly what you want.&#8221; 

Sad state of affairs. Reminds me of how people complain about what they get in free goodie bags because the gifts are not what they want.
