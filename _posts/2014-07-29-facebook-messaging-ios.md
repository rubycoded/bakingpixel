9to5Mac reported that [Facebook will be disabling messaging in its main iOS app this week](http://9to5mac.com/2014/07/28/facebook-to-disable-messaging-in-its-main-ios-app-this-week-require-messenger-for-all-users/). Users will have to download its Messenger app.

This might be a good thing for those of us who are trying to spend less time on Facebook. Personally, I tend to get distracted by Facebook when I have to go into Facebook to reply messages. I have cut down distraction a lot ever since I started using the standalone Facebook Messenger app.

It will be interesting to see what Facebook plans to do with a two messaging apps in Messenger and Whatsapp.
