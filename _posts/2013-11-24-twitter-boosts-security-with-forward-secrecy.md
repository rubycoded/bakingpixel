The battle for privacy continues.

[Forward Secrecy at Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/forward-secrecy-at-twitter-0)

> On top of the usual confidentiality and integrity properties of HTTPS, forward secrecy adds a new property. If an adversary is currently recording all Twitter users’ encrypted traffic, and they later crack or steal Twitter’s private keys, they should not be able to use those keys to decrypt the recorded traffic.
