Investors.com reported on the [mobile market in Q4 of 2013](http://news.investors.com/technology-click/021114-689654-2014-mobile-phone-market-to-see-little-or-no-growth.htm).

> Apple and Samsung continue to soak up all the industry&#8217;s profits, McCourt says. Apple claimed 87.4% of phone earnings before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter, he said. Samsung took in 32.2% of industry profits. Because their combined earnings were higher than the industry&#8217;s total earnings as a result of many vendors losing money in Q4, Apple and Samsung mathematically accounted for more than 100% of the industry&#8217;s earnings. 

Based on the reported figures, Apple and Samsung took in about 120% of the profits. The competitors are making huge losses.
