Reuters reported that [Vimeo revenue jumped 54 percent in 2018, paying subscribers near 1 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vimeo-results-idUSKCN1PW2OJ).

> Its 2018 revenue of $160 million — disclosed for the first time by IAC — rose from $103.3 million in the previous year, while the number of paying subscribers climbed 9 percent year-over-year to about 952,000 by the end of December.
> 
> Although Vimeo’s revenue is expected to rise “20 to 30 percent in the near-term,” according to its Chief Executive Anjali Sud, the video service is far from making a profit as it burns cash on product development and aggressive marketing to popularize its brand. 

This reminds me of an analogy I came across a few days back.

In this scenario, we can take these additional steps:  
1. Buy $20,000 worth of salt  
2. Sell for $16,000.  
3. Now you get a 60% increase in revenue.

People often get too caught up with revenue figures without looking deeper to understand the actual health of a company. That being said, the same applies in the opposite direction. Figures can make the situation look worse than it is if you don&#8217;t get to see the bigger picture, or if you look at the numbers with misleading or even wrong information.
