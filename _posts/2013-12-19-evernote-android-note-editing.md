Evernote has [updated its Android app with improved not editing](http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/12/17/evernote-for-android-gets-improved-note-editing/).

> If you are like many Evernote users, then youâ€™re creating notes across a variety of platforms. It used to be that when you tried to edit one of these notes on Android, you were likely to wipe out much of the text styling. Not anymore. Now, Evernote for Android has expanded its support for styles created in other versions of Evernote. Also, if a given style is unsupported on Android, the app will allow you to edit the content, while maintaining the styling so that it displays correctly when viewed on other platforms. 

Good news for Android Evernote users.
