We brought your attention to LINE recently, notably when the popular Asian messaging system hit the [300 million user milestone](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/lines-300-million-users-will-be-a-problem-for-whatsapp/). The company isn&#8217;t intent on resting on its laurels, and has just launched LINE Shopping in Malaysia today. The launch of LINE Shopping in Indonesia at the end of November was quite successful, collecting about 900,000 subscribers within a week. You can bet that Naver (the company behind LINE) is looking to repeat that feat or improve upon it.

LINE is already well known for its adorable and expressive stickers, and offering a free sticker set as an incentive to get folks to subscribe will definitely drive subscription numbers.

The next step will be to see how well LINE harnesses its subscriber base to promote wares from its retail partners, including Groupon, Lazada, Zalora, Rakuten, Superbuy, H&M and more. With messaging platforms being highly personal, if LINE manages to continue its growth trajectory and strengthen partnerships, it&#8217;ll be able to have an edge against competitors in Asia such as WeChat and Kakao Talk.
