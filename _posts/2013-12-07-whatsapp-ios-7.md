The Next Web reports that [WhatsApp has finally been updated for iOS 7](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/12/03/whatsapp-finally-updated-for-ios-7-adds-broadcast-to-list-feature-and-more/).

Aside from a refreshed design that sports the iOS 7-style look, the app now lets users broadcast to lists to communicate to many people at once.

Image thumbnails are now larger, making it possible to see greater details in photos without having to open them.

WhatsApp might be losing the messaging race to [Line](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/lines-300-million-users-will-be-a-problem-for-whatsapp/) and [WeChat](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/tencent-billion-users/), but it is the first to roll out its iOS 7 design.
