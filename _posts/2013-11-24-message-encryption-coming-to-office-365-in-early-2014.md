While there is still a lot of concern over the NSA having access to data from large technology companies, one of the best tools for end users to protect their privacy would be proper encryption. Offering [message encryption](http://blogs.office.com/b/office365tech/archive/2013/11/21/introducing-office-365-message-encryption-send-encrypted-emails-to-anyone.aspx) on Office 365 is a good step in that direction.

> In the age of pervasive data abduction by government agency, keeping your private stuff private is an increasingly important issue. The addition of message encryption to Office 365 is therefore on point, and potentially very useful.
> 
> The system is neat: Once administrators turn it on, emails that are sent are encrypted before they are fired out, meaning that they only leave the house after they put a jacket on. The recipient receives an email that has an encrypted attachment. Thatâ€™s the message.
