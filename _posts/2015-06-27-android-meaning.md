>   4. (or perhaps 3.1) &#8216;Modified&#8217; Android as seen on Xiaomi phones and those of its followers, which people actually seek out, and which comes without Google services in China and with them elsewhere  
>     ROMs and third-party implementations of Android that are available for any handset, such as both Xiaomi&#8217;s MIUI and Cyanogen (an a16z portfolio company), which may or may not have Google services included or accessible. Again, these contain optimisations and improvements that make people seek them out

Confusing. But at least know that they are not the same.
