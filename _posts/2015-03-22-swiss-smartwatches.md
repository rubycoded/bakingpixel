Quartz reported on [Swiss smartwatches chances against the Apple Watch](http://qz.com/365899/why-swiss-smartwatches-have-no-chance-against-the-apple-watch/).

> It is possible, we suppose, that Tag Heuer could somehow teach itself to become the world’s foremost wrist-computer company—and leapfrog Apple—by next year. But that seems extremely unlikely. Apple didn’t just take a heritage watch case, add a screen, and shove in a microchip and a bunch of sensors. And as Biver is about to discover, trying to integrate one company’s microchip with another’s operating system and app ecosystem, then reconciling that combination with your company’s century-old design ideals is going to require some major compromises. 

Just look at Microsoft and Google&#8217;s attempts at making phones on their own.
