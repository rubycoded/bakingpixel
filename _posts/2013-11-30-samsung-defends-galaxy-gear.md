BGR reports Samsung executive David Eun [responded to criticism of the Galaxy Gear saying it is a work in progress](http://bgr.com/2013/11/18/samsung-defends-galaxy-gear/).

> “What we’re dealing with is small green tomatoes,” he said of the Gear’s first-generation growing pains. “And what we want to do is take care of them and work with them so they become big, red ripe tomatoes. And what you want to be sure of is that you don’t pluck the green tomato too early and you want to make sure that you don’t criticize a small green tomato for not being a big, red ripe tomato.” 

That is another way of telling consumers who bought the Galaxy Gear that Samsung’s marketing team succeeded in getting them to pay $300 for an unfinished product.
