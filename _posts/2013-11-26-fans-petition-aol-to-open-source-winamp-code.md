Considering the history of Winamp, I&#8217;m not surprised that many people are sad at its [impending shut down](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/winamp-presses-stop/). I honestly doubt that a [petition](https://www.change.org/en-AU/petitions/aol-keep-winamp-alive-or-let-it-go-open-source) to keep the project alive or letting it go open source will gain any traction at AOL, but I guess there isn&#8217;t any harm in trying.

> &#8220;The history of digital music started with Winamp,&#8221; says the group, which includes nine developers who have pledged to improve Winamp if the source code is released. &#8220;Our goal is to convince Nullsoft [the AOL subsidiary behind Winamp] to release the Winamp source code and we will take it further in an open-source way.&#8221;
