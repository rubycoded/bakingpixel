[Meet “badBIOS,” the mysterious Mac and PC malware that jumps airgaps](http://http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/10/meet-badbios-the-mysterious-mac-and-pc-malware-that-jumps-airgaps/)

> Another intriguing characteristic: in addition to jumping &#8220;airgaps&#8221; designed to isolate infected or sensitive machines from all other networked computers, the malware seems to have self-healing capabilities.
> 
> &#8220;We had an air-gapped computer that just had its [firmware] BIOS reflashed, a fresh disk drive installed, and zero data on it, installed from a Windows system CD,&#8221; Ruiu said. &#8220;At one point, we were editing some of the components and our registry editor got disabled. It was like: wait a minute, how can that happen? How can the machine react and attack the software that we&#8217;re using to attack it? This is an air-gapped machine and all of a sudden the search function in the registry editor stopped working when we were using it to search for their keys.&#8221; 

Update 6 Nov 2013: Some researchers are [having trouble](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/researcher-skepticism-grows-over-badbios-malware-claims/) reproducing the symptoms described in the badBIOS report. Of course, since we&#8217;re still in the early stages, it&#8217;s hard to confirm or disregard this just yet.
