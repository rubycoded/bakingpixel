> From Dontkillmyapp&#8217;s list, Nokia is the example I&#8217;ll use here, but the list of offenders includes OnePlus, Sony, and Samsung, too. Even Google itself is called out for making it difficult to exempt an app from getting &#8220;Dozed&#8221;. Nokia includes an app on every phone the company makes that runs Android Oreo or higher that kills every background process 20 minutes after the screen is turned off. That means fitness apps are never going to work, but it also means that your alarm isn&#8217;t going to go off if you have Android P. 

Battery life is more important to Android phone makers than whether apps work well. App developers have to dance around the rules set by phone makers just to make apps that work as designed for Android users.

What&#8217;s your experience with Android apps on your Android phone?
