Apple reported its [third quarter results](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/07/22Apple-Reports-Third-Quarter-Results.html).

> The Company posted quarterly revenue of $37.4 billion and quarterly net profit of $7.7 billion, or $1.28 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $35.3 billion and net profit of $6.9 billion, or $1.07 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. 

So much for the predicted [doom and gloom](http://fortune.com/2014/07/16/apple-and-ibm-what-the-analysts-are-saying/):

As several sites pointed out, Apple spent noticeably more in research and development, leading to speculations that new product lines are being worked on.
