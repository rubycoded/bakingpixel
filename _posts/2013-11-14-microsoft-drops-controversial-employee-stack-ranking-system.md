[Ex-Microsoft employee and well known Internet personality Robert Scoble&#8217;s view on Microsoft&#8217;s controversial stack ranking system](https://www.facebook.com/RobertScoble/posts/10151991098834655)

> This is a big deal for Microsoft. As its businesses are being threatened things I never expected to happen have happened. Ballmer is gone. Sinofsky is gone. Stack ranking is gone.
> 
> I left Microsoft in 2006 because I knew there wasn&#8217;t a product pipeline. Since then, what has Microsoft done that&#8217;s truly innovative? Kinect is the only thing that comes to mind. Really horrid for a company that has 90,000 smart people.
