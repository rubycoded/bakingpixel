The Verge reported on [Apple being cleared in the iTunes DRM case](http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/16/7402695/jury-decision-in-iTunes-iPod-DRM-case).

> Delivering a unanimous verdict today, the group said Apple&#8217;s iTunes 7.0, released in the fall of 2006, was a &#8220;genuine product improvement,&#8221; meaning that new features (though importantly increased security) were good for consumers. Plaintiffs in the case unsuccessfully argued that those features not only thwarted competition, but also made Apple&#8217;s products less useful since customers could not as easily use purchased music or jukebox software from other companies with the iPod. 

There wasn&#8217;t much of a case after it was discovered that the plaintiffs [did not even own the affected iPod models](http://www.macworld.com/article/2856134/apple-asks-court-to-dismiss-itunes-drm-case-after-curious-plaintiff-twist.html).
