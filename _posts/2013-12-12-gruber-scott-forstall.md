John Gruber writes on Daring Fireball [about why there was no news about Scott Forstall in the past 13 months](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/12/10/forstall).

> What Iâ€™ve heard is that when Tim Cook fired him, Forstall was offered (and accepted) a big truck full of money as part of a severance package. The terms of the severance agreement included a period of time during which Forstall can not (could not?) work for any other company, nor make any public statements. 

While other news outlets report on the mystery of what happened to Forstall or that he was laying low, Gruber provides something more insightful.
