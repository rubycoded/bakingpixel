Reuters reports that [Samsung is saying it has sold 800,000 Galaxy Gear, making it the world’s most popular smartwatch](http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-sells-800000-galaxy-gear-watches-2013-11).

Does the figure exclude Galaxy Gear sets that consumers get for free when they buy a Galaxy Note 3? I think not.

Update: I forgot to link to an earlier article about [poor sales of the Galaxy Gear](http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/article/2219/galaxy-round-gear-are-revolutionary-products-just-pilots). The article reports that “this product has cumulative sales under 50,000, with daily sales of only 800-900 units”. Samsung’s figure is the number of Galaxy Gear shipped, not the number sold.
