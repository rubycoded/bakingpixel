Bloomberg reported on [ex-GM CEO Dan Akerson saying building cars may not be worth it for Apple](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-18/former-gm-ceo-akerson-cautions-apple-on-trials-of-making-cars).

> “I think somebody is kind of trying to cough up a hairball here,” Akerson said in a telephone interview. “If I were an Apple shareholder, I wouldn’t be very happy. I would be highly suspect of the long-term prospect of getting into a low-margin, heavy-manufacturing” business.  
> The car industry, with regulatory and safety requirements, is harder than people realize, Akerson said.  
> “A lot of people who don’t ever operate in it don’t understand and have a tendency to underestimate,” he said. 

As [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/02/18/hairball) pointed out, this sounds familiar.

Back when rumours of Apple entering the phone market, then Palm CEO Ed Colligan [scoffed at the idea](http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/columnists/16057579.htm):

> Responding to questions from New York Times correspondent John Markoff at a Churchill Club breakfast gathering Thursday morning, Colligan laughed off the idea that any company — including the wildly popular Apple Computer — could easily win customers in the finicky smart-phone sector.
> 
> “We’ve learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make a decent phone,” he said. “PC guys are not going to just figure this out. They’re not going to just walk in.”
