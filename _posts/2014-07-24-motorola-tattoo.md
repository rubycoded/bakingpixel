Engadget reported about [the new NFC skin tag from Motorola that lets you unlock your phone by tapping on the tattoo](http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/22/digital-tattoo-phone-unlock/).

> VivaLnk is asking $10 for packs of 10 tattoos, or enough to last 50 days &#8212; you&#8217;ll have to spend $80 to get through a whole year. 

How is this going to be more intuitive than using your finger to unlock the phone?
