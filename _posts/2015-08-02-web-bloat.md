If I&#8217;m lucky, some or most of this will get cached between requests so it won&#8217;t be quite that bad. In fact, another report tells me that a primed cache yields 8MB transferred &#8211; so maybe 4 visits per day. 

It is a big concern and something I have become conscious of after my data usage spiked last month, despite me being overseas and not using my data plan for a week. Websites need to be more responsible with how they push content and advertising to us.

The web is stuffed full of call-to-actions, social media buttons, advertising, making the whole experience of surfing the web unbearable. I hate websites with ads that cover the content, making you unable to browse the site and leading you to inadvertently tap on the ad.
