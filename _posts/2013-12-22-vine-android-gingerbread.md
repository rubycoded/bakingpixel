Vine has announced [a new version of its app for Android that runs on Gingerbread devices](http://blog.vine.co/post/70430566125/vine-now-available-on-gingerbread-android-devices). The app only allows content consumption but not creation.

> Please note that due to device limitations, this version of Vine doesn’t allow for video creation. However, there are tons of great Vine videos to entertain you. We hope you enjoy watching! 

You can have your pie, or gingerbread, but you can’t eat it. Would it make you hungry enough to want to upgrade your phone?
