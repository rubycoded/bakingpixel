NYT Bits reported on [iOS 8 privacy data](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/with-ios-8-apple-says-data-is-better-protected-even-from-the-police/).

> “Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data,” the company said on the new webpage. “So it’s not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8.”
> 
> “Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products,” he said. “We don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers.” 

Other tech companies need to take note.
