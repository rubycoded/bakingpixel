Matthew Panzarino reports for TechCrunch about [Uber’s new version of Uber Lost](http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/14/uber-quietly-spins-up-new-system-helping-riders-look-for-lost-items/).

> The system is nothing complex, it just provides you with a simple list of your recent trips, with beginning and end points to help you figure out where you were when you lost the item. Each ride entry contains the driver’s name and phone number so you can ring them up directly to ask them if they’ve found your item.
> 
> With the Uber system you’re presented with a way to call the driver back directly, rather than wading through the call center of a cab company and trying to cross reference time, location and cab availability.
