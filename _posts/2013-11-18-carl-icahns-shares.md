AllThignsD reports that [Carl Icahn owns 4.7 million Apple shares](http://allthingsd.com/20131115/carl-icahn-now-owns-about-2-5-billion-worth-of-apple-shares/).

> But in a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, released to shareholders last month, Icahn disclosed that his stake has grown to 4.7 million shares, which, as of yesterday’s closing price, would be worth $2.5 billion. 

Then again, he did say that it was not personal when he demanded Apple for a share buyback.
