Mashable reported on [the sad, expensive failure of Google+](http://mashable.com/2015/08/02/google-plus-history/).

> Google&#8217;s effort to build a social network to rival Facebook began with a bold, company-wide yell. Now Google appears to be winding down Google+ with barely a whimper.
> 
> This week, four years and one month after launching Google+ with the stated mission to &#8220;fix&#8221; online sharing, Google announced it would eliminate a much-criticized requirement to use a Google+ account when signing on to other Google services like YouTube. The move is the clearest indication yet that Google is ditching its playbook of trying to push everyone in the world use its social network. 

I have moved away from Google+ for quite some time, pushing articles to it to share to followers but nothing more than that.
