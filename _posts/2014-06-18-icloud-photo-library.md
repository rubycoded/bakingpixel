While there were plenty of goodies to take away from WWDC, one announcement announcement in particular had me dancing for joy &#8211; [iCloud Photo Library](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/photos/).

If there was one major aspect of iOS that needed improving, it was photo management capabilities. Whether you&#8217;re an iPhoto user or not, managing photos on the iPhone is a major pain. It was obvious that it was an issue that needed to be resolved, which birthed apps such as [Loom](https://loom.com) (which was [acquired by Dropbox](https://blog.loom.com/loom-is-joining-dropbox-2/)) and [Carousel by Dropbox](https://www.carousel.com).

One minor annoyance (albeit a first world problem) I have with it is that the accompanying Mac app is slated to arrive later. Of course, in a perfect world it&#8217;d be released together with iOS 8 and [Yosemite](https://www.apple.com/osx/preview/apps/), but I understand that with so many new announcements, even Apple&#8217;s resources might be a little stretched. In the end, I&#8217;d rather have a feature/software that arrives late and works well, than one that arrives early and doesn&#8217;t work as advertised.

The full details of iCloud Photo Library haven&#8217;t been revealed yet, but one thing that I hope is available would be the ability to mark specific folders to be stored for offline use in iOS

Now the waiting game begins.
