    It doesn’t work very well in iOS 13, either. Many times, I’ll type the exact text that appears in the app, and it won’t find it. So I mostly just scroll and read. A long time ago, I reverse-engineered the transcript file format for EagleFiler, so that’s how I search older messages. Unlike in Messages, the matches are highlighted, and you can select the text.

    When I need to find something in my iMessages I just grab my iPhone. And let’s not forget that this option has only become viable since iOS13, before which it was just as bad on there as well.

That&#8217;s what I do as well. Search works so much better on the iPhone. Keying in the same text generally gives me no results on the Mac and what I&#8217;m looking for on the iPhone.

In comparison, It&#8217;s so easy to search in Telegram and WeChat on macOS.
