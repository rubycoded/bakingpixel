Mashable reports on [BlackBerry’s $4.4 billion net loss in this quarter](http://mashable.com/2013/12/20/blackberry-hits-rock-bottom/).

> BlackBerry&#8217;s revenue in the third quarter fell by more than 50% from the same period a year earlier. The company&#8217;s net loss for the quarter topped $4 billion due to restructuring costs and unsold devices. Yes, billion with a &#8220;b.&#8221; And it barely sold more than 1 million BB10 devices, proving once more that its make-or-break smartphone product line is broken. 

BlackBerry has decided to fight smaller battles by focussing on markets where they are strong in, such as in Indonesia. I know many Indonesians who love their BlackBerry devices but if the company does no prove to be an attractive alternative to the iPhones or Android devices, it will be a futile move.
