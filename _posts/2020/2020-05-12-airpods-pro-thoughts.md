    Overall, I find it difficult to evaluate AirPods Pro because I have such mixed feelings about them. If I had to pick one model, I would buy the Pros because the seal and noise cancellation make them usable in situations where I couldn’t use the regular AirPods. That said, in situations where I don’t need noise cancellation or a long battery life, I always reach for my original AirPods. They feel better in my ears, and the case makes me happy.

Interesting review. I love my AirPods 2 and I&#8217;ve been curious to try the AirPods Pro, especially when I encounter situations that active noise cancelling would have been awesome.

Also, Matt and I had a [short chat about AirPods](https://www.facebook.com/kinson7/videos/10158562776991155/) a few days back.
