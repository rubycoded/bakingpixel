[Epic Games email to players](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/28/fortnite-emails-new-season-unavailable/) via MacRumors:

> Apple is blocking Fortnite updates and new installs on the ‌App Store‌, and has said they will terminate our ability to develop Fortnite for Apple devices. As a result, the Chapter 2 - Season 4 update (v14.00), did not release on iOS and macOS on August 27.
> 
> Apple limits competition so they can collect 30% of consumer payments made in apps like Fortnite, raising the prices you pay. Epic lowered prices through a direct payment option, but Apple is blocking Fortnite in order to prevent Epic from passing on the savings from direct payments to players. Epic has taken legal action to end Apple's anti-competitive restrictions on mobile device marketplaces. Papers are available for our August 13, August 17, and August 23 filings. In retaliation for this action, Apple blocked your access to Fortnite updates and new installs on all iOS devices.

I can see why people who don't know the whole story will jump on Apple. Epic Games is banking on their user base to not know what's going on. But will they be as forgiving once the players realise what Epic Games is doing?

1. It is not a case of Apple blocking the update. It is Epic Games choosing to violate the app store policy in their update.
2. The result of the new season not being released on iOS and macOS is because of Epic Game's choice.
3. The macOS app isn't affected, but Epic Games choose to remove it as well.
4. Apple Did not block player access to updates. Epic Games chose not to release an update that conforms to the app store policy, like their previous updates have.

Does Epic Games think that they can fool their userbase by pinning the blame of them violating terms of service on Apple?
