<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    France just passed a new law forcing major social media platforms requiring social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to remove sensitive content related to pedophilia and terrorism within just one hour of notification.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This new order also states that these platforms need to remove hateful content promoting racism, sexual discrimination, sexual harassment, and aggravated insults within 24 hours of notification.

Having seen hate speech run amok on social media of late, this is a much needed move.
