[The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/27/facebook_ios_ads/):

> Facebook has apologized to its users and advertisers for being forced to respect people’s privacy in an upcoming update to Apple’s mobile operating system – and promised it will do its best to invade their privacy on other platforms.
> 
> The antisocial network that makes almost all of its revenue from building a vast, constantly updated database of netizens that it then sells access to, is upset that iOS 14, due out next month, will require apps to ask users for permission before Facebook grabs data from their phones.

Your first reaction is probably, "This is satire."

Then you realise it's real.

> Facebook wants advertisers to know however that it has their back. It will continue to suck as much information as possible off every other device and through every other operating system.
> 
> [...]
> 
> Facebook closes out by promising that it will do all it can to prevent user privacy from being respected in future. “We believe that industry consultation is critical for changes to platform policies, as these updates have a far-reaching impact on the developer ecosystem," it said.

Ok.
