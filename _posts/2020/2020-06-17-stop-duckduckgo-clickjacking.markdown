> DuckDuckGo still uses JavaScript to intercept your link clicks, and thereâ€™s no good reason for it. One consequence of this clickjacking is that your Safari browsing history gets messed up.

This explains why some sites are missing in Safari history. Also, when I type in the search bar and then open a suggested link that was discovered via a DuckDuckGo search it brings me back to the search results instead of the site.
