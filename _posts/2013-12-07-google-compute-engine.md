ReadWriteWeb reports that [Google Ups The Ante Against Amazon&#8217;s Cloud, And That&#8217;s A Good Thing For Business – ReadWrite](http://readwrite.com/2013/12/04/google-compute-engine).

> Google has spent $2.9 billion on hardware alone to get its service up and running. The company says it designed its Compute Engine to be simple enough for people to understand and manage, much the same way they manage their Gmail accounts, upload videos to YouTube, and share files within Google Drive.
> 
> To entice business people to use its Compute Engine, Google is offering a 10% discount for standard services; support for more Linux operating system types; and improvements to its maintenance services including an “automatic restart” feature should there be a major catastrophe. 

[Amazon is leading the cloud-computing market](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/is-amazon-winning-the-cloud-battle/), with forecasts suggesting that Amazon Web Services will bring in over $3 billion in revenue.
