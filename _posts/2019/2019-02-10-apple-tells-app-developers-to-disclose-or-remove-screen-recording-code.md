Zack Whittaker reported for TechCrunch that [Apple is telling app developers to disclose or remove screen recording code](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/apple-glassbox-apps/).

> It follows an investigation by TechCrunch that revealed major companies, like Expedia, Hollister and Hotels.com, were using a third-party analytics tool to record every tap and swipe inside the app. We found that none of the apps we tested asked the user for permission, and none of the companies said in their privacy policies that they were recording a user’s app activity.
> 
> Even though sensitive data is supposed to be masked, some data — like passport numbers and credit card numbers — was leaking. 

Apple is giving the app developers only 24 hours to remove the screen recording codes, or the apps would be removed from the App Store.

What is notable here isn&#8217;t the speed at which Apple is enforcing this. It&#8217;s the lack of action from Google or any other Android app stores. If you are using Android version of these apps, it would be safer to assume that these apps are still recording your screens as you use the apps.
