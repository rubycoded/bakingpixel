Business Insider reported that [Facebook says it &#8216;unintentionally uploaded&#8217; 1.5 million people&#8217;s email contacts without their consent](https://www.businessinsider.in/Facebook-says-it-unintentionally-uploaded-1-5-million-peoples-email-contacts-without-their-consent/articleshow/68930320.cms).

> Facebook harvested the email contacts of 1.5 million users without their knowledge or consent when they opened their accounts.
> 
> Since May 2016, the social-networking company has collected the contact lists of 1.5 million users new to the social network, Business Insider can reveal. The Silicon Valley company said the contact data was &#8220;unintentionally uploaded to Facebook,&#8221; and it is now deleting them. 

How can this be unintentional? Facebook asked new accounts to enter their email passwords. That was already one big no-no. Then Facebook imports contacts from the email account. It actually shows a message saying it is importing the contacts, so that functionality is built in.

This highlights the importance of fencing your online accounts. I highly recommend that you don&#8217;t allow any third party to access your email account. Have a secondary account liked to your primary account, and if you really have to, allow access to the secondary account instead.
