Pew Research Center reported about [Facebook algorithms and personal data](http://www.pewinternet.org/2019/01/16/facebook-algorithms-and-personal-data/).

> Facebook makes it relatively easy for users to find out how the site’s algorithm has categorized their interests via a “Your ad preferences” page. Overall, however, 74% of Facebook users say they did not know that this list of their traits and interests existed until they were directed to their page as part of this study. 

Help educate your friends and family about how Facebook monetises their interests.
