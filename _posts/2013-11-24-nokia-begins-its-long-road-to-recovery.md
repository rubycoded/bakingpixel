With much of it sold to Microsoft, Nokia will probably never be the same again. The next chapter in the Finnish company&#8217;s history will depend on how well it can reinvent itself.

[Nokia, Once The World&#8217;s Biggest Mobile-Phone Maker, Is Planning The Next Bounceback](http://www.businessinsider.com/nokia-once-the-worlds-biggest-mobile-phone-maker-is-planning-the-next-bounceback-2013-11)

> Nokia is also keen to talk up its other two businesses. The larger is HERE, its highly regarded maps division, which has most of the market for navigation systems built into cars. The smaller, Advanced Technologies, will have the job of licensing Nokia’s thousands of patents and coming up with more bright ideas. Risto Siilasmaa, the chairman and acting chief executive, calls it “our innovation engine”. Most of the uncertainty about Nokia’s future has to do with how well this engine fires.
