Forbes reports that [Microsoft might lose its revenue from licensing patents to Android phone makers](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/12/06/german-patent-ruling-threatens-microsofts-windows-phone-earnings-from-android/).

> Microsoft makes money out of many to most of the Android handsets out there. It’s a substantial chunk of revenue too. On the grapevine we’ve been told that HTC pays $5 a handset, Samsung perhaps as much as $10. We don’t know the total number as Microsoft doesn’t break it out in their accounts but books it in the same division as the Windows Phone licence revenues. And we’re all pretty sure that the Android royalties are larger in that division than the Windows Phone revenues. 

Previously, I wrote about how [Microsoft is making $2 billion from Android patents](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/microsoft-earnings-losses/). This ruling holds a lot of significance because the judgement will be applied across the European Union, and the ruling is very likely to be the same in the US. It will be a big blow for Microsoft if it lost licensing revenue from the US and EU.
