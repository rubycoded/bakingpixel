The European Commission announced that [airlines will be permitted to deplay 3G and LTE networks on their planes](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-1066_en.htm).

> The Commission has adopted new rules that allow the latest wireless communication technology to be used by passengers on board aircraft flying over the European Union.
> 
> This means that from now onwards, spectrum for 3G (UMTS) and 4G (LTE) communications may be used above an altitude of 3000 metres. Until now only 2G (GSM) has been permissible on-board aircraft flying in the EU, which is impracticable sending large amounts of data (for example sending large attachments, downloading eBooks, watching video). 

This comes just a day after the [EASA allowed the use of electronic devices during take-off and landing](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/11/easa-allows-electronics/).
