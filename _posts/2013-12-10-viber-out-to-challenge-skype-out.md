Viber [introduced](http://www.financialpost.com/markets/news/Viber+Launches+Viber+Worldwide+Allowing+More+Than+Million+Users+Make/9266858/story.html) its Viber Out during the recent typhoon disaster in the Philippines and now the feature has gone official, allowing Android, iOS, and dekstop users of its service to make cheap international phone calls to traditional phone numbers. Windows Phone users should be receiving support for this feature soon too.

According to a price comparison table, the company touts that Skype Out calls can cost up to 486% more than Viber Out, though that would depend on the country that you&#8217;re calling to. Following its [launch of stickers](http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/12/viber-flips-monetization-switch-launches-sticker-market-in-4-0-update/), the launch of Viber Out allows the company continues its march towards successful monetization.

Based on my experiences with both apps, I still feel that Skype has better call quality, but having to constantly sign into Skype in order to use it is always an inconvenience, as opposed to the &#8220;always on&#8221; operation method of modern messaging/calling apps. Whether this difference will be a deciding factor or not remains to be seen.

> The service — which was first opened in the Philippines last month in the aftermath of a devastating typhoon — is available for all users of Android and iOS smartphones and the desktop app. Viber says it will roll out to Windows Phone customers soon.
