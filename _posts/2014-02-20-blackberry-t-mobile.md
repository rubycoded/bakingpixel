BlackBerry CEO John Chen [responds to T-Mobile’s campaign](http://blogs.blackberry.com/2014/02/blackberry-tmo/).

Is T-Mobile wrong to offer a better alternative for its customers? Definitely not. T-Mobile should be applauded for putting their customers first and not be afraid of ruffling the feathers of phone makers. Perhaps if BlackBerry put out new products, T-Mobile might actually have something to offer existing BlackBerry users to upgrade to.

Here’s another perspective of how BlackBerry has fallen. WhatsApp started as an app that provided a cross-platform alternative to BlackBerry Messenger. It just sold for more than what BlackBerry is worth.

John Legere’s tweet speaks volumes of difference in how the two CEOs engage their customers:

    Was going to engage John Chen on Twitter, but turns out he’s not here. I'll check MySpace. Don’t worry <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackBerry">@BlackBerry</a> Something in the works!
