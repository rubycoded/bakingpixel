Some folks might think that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Icahn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carl Icahn</a>&#8216;s plans for Apple&#8217;s cash pile is good for the company. After successfully taking Dell private, Michael Dell disagrees, though.

> “It’s a big poker game to him,” says Dell. “It’s not about the customers. It’s not about the people. It’s not about changing the world. He doesn’t give a crap about any of that. He didn’t know whether we made nuclear power plants or French fries. He didn’t care.”
