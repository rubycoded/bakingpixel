WIRED UK reports that [Microsoft has designed a smart bra to combat emotional eating](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-12/06/microsoft-smart-bra).

> But the team wanted to have a system of wearable sensors that measure electrodermal activity (EDA), which is essentially the amount of sweat on a person&#8217;s skin; and electrocardiogram (EKG) data. Both are useful for gauging emotions. 

Wearable devices that know you inside out.
