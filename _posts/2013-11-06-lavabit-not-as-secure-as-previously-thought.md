A lot has been made recently over the NSA&#8217;s actions, but regardless of which side of the fence you&#8217;re on, having the option for secure, encrypted emails is always important. It&#8217;s possible that Lavabit [wasn&#8217;t as secure as it was marketed to be](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/op-ed-a-critique-of-lavabit/), but that doesn&#8217;t mean that we should ignore the importance of encryption, especially in this day and age.

Will we ever have truly private and secure email?

> Despite the use of cryptography, Lavabit is also vulnerable to all three just like a conventional (unencrypted) e-mail service. The operator can, at any time, stop averting their eyes, an attacker who compromises the server can log the password a user transmits, and an attacker who can intercept communication to the server can obtain the password as well as the plaintext e-mail.

> Even though Lavabit&#8217;s security page went on at length about how, in the age of the PATRIOT act, users shouldn&#8217;t accept a Privacy Policy as enough to protect them, that is almost exactly what it implemented. The cryptography was nothing more than a lot of overhead and some shorthand for a promise not to peek. Even though it advertised that it &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; read your e-mail, what it meant was that it would choose not to.
