Business Insider reports on [how LeBron James reacted to his Samsung’ meltdown](http://www.businessinsider.sg/lebron-james-samsung-tweet-2014-3/).

His tweet:

> My phone just erased everything it had in it and rebooted. One of the sickest feelings I&#8217;ve ever had in my life!!! 

Upon realising that he just bashed his sponsor, he deletes his tweet. Another PR disaster for Samsung, but at least he didn’t [tweet with an iPhone](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/03/03/oscars-host-ellen-degeneres-poses-for-samsung-sponsored-selfie-but-tweets-from-her-iphone).
