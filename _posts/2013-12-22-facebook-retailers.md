Business Insider writes about [how online retailers have been hit hard by Facebook’s new News Feed](http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-screwed-lots-of-retailers-2013-12).

> It turns out the News Feed tweak did more than just highlight “high quality” news stories. It also totally buried posts from retailers on Facebook.
> 
> A source from one retailer told us that her company’s “reach” on Facebook declined 40% to 50% after the change. Another source from a different online retailer said that since Facebook&#8217;s change, her company&#8217;s posts are getting seen by an 80% smaller audience. 

Not that the change in reach affected sales:

> All the retailers we spoke to emphasized that their actual sales have not declined since Facebook made the change. But each said they&#8217;ve only been able to maintain sales by increasing the amount of money they spend on Facebook ads. 

It seems like [social media marketers are not the only one affected by Facebook’s new algorithm](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/12/facebook-social-media-marketers/).

Facebook wants businesses to pay to enjoy the benefits of using it as a marketing and advertising platform. The change won’t hurt big businesses or established brands, but it will make it a lot harder for smaller start-ups to gain a foothold now.
