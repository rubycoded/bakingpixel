Engadget reports on [Samsung&#8217;s quarterly earnings](http://www.engadget.com/2014/07/08/samsung-warns-of-profit-drop-q2-2014/).

> Samsung&#8217;s marketing budget has always been vast, but in the last quarter it was far larger than even the manufacturer itself would have liked. The company admits that it&#8217;s been forced to spend extra money on promotions for older and lower-end devices that have been filling up its warehouses due to &#8220;weak demand.&#8221; This dip in trade, combined with the extra spend on publicity, is causing the company&#8217;s recent, gradual profit decline to quicken: it now expects to earn around 24 percent less this quarter than it did a year ago, with underlying sales down by an estimated 8-11 percent. 

When you have [so many different phones](http://bakingpixel.com/2014/06/samsung-insanity/) and provide little or no support for the older and lower-end phones, why would people want to buy them? The key [lies in focus](http://bakingpixel.com/2014/07/apples-philosophy/).

Another thing they need to ask themselves is it whether it is worthwhile to [splurge on advertising](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/12/samsung-advertising/)? Especially when they people they sponsor actually [prefer to use the iPhone](http://bakingpixel.com/2013/12/samsung-beckenbauer/).
