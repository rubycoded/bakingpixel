Kate O&#8217;Neill reported for Wired about [Facebook&#8217;s &#8217;10 Year Challenge&#8217;](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-10-year-meme-challenge/).

> Through the Facebook meme, most people have been helpfully adding that context back in (“me in 2008 and me in 2018”) as well as further info, in many cases, about where and how the pic was taken (“2008 at University of Whatever, taken by Joe; 2018 visiting New City for this year’s such-and-such event”).
> 
> In other words, thanks to this meme, there’s now a very large dataset of carefully curated photos of people from roughly 10 years ago and now. 

The question is not where this meme originated from or whether it was started for malicious purposes. It is very plausible for that this data could be use to teach AI about how human ages.
