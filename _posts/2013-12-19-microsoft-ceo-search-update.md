Microsoft’s board of directors had decided that it is necessary for them to post on the company’s official blog to give [an update on their search for a new CEO](http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2013/12/17/microsoft-board-of-directors-update-on-ceo-search.aspx).

> As the chair of the Board’s search committee, I’m pleased with our progress. The Board has taken the thoughtful approach that our shareholders, customers, partners and employees expect and deserve. After defining our criteria, we initially cast a wide net across a number of different industries and skill sets. We identified over 100 possible candidates, talked with several dozen, and then focused our energy intensely on a group of about 20 individuals, all extremely impressive in their own right. As you would expect, as this group has narrowed, we’ve done deeper research and investigation, including with the full Board. We’re moving ahead well, and I expect we’ll complete our work in the early part of 2014. 

Reacting to the uncertainty over the CEO search? Regardless of whether they manage to settle the nerves of investors and consumers, it still does not hide the fact that there was no succession planning in place.
