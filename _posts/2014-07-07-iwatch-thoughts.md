Monday Note shared some [iWatch Thoughts](http://www.mondaynote.com/2014/06/23/iwatch-thoughts/).

> The most ambitious rumors project 50 million iWatches sold in the first 12 months. I think that’s an unrealistic estimate, but if a $300 iWatch can sell at these numbers, that’s $15B for the year. This seems like a huge number until you compare it to a conservative estimate for the iPhone: 50 million iPhones at $650 generates $32B per quarter.
