Softpedia reported on [Samsung not patching kernel vulnerabilities in non-Lollipop S4 phones](http://news.softpedia.com/news/samsung-decides-not-to-patch-kernel-vulnerabilities-in-some-s4-smartphones-493519.shtml).

> According to Jonathan Salwan, one of QuarksLAB&#8217;s junior security researchers, Samsung took 3 months to acknowledge the bugs (November 2014), and only responded to QuarksLAB&#8217;s emails after the company went public with their research on September 21, 2015.

> &#8220;They just acknowledged the issues, then went silent until this blog post popped,&#8221; said Mr. Salwan. &#8220;Samsung just confirmed to us that the JB and KK families will not be patched and that the vulnerabilities are only patched on the LL family.&#8221; 

Because security is a priority.
