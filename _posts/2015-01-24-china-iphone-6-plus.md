AppLovin reported on [an increase in Apple&#8217;s iPhone 6 Plus sales in China](http://blog.applovin.com/china_6_plus_totes_epic/).

> Plus (pun intended), Morgan Stanley estimates that the 6 Plus’ profit margins are as much as 61% higher than that of the iPhone 6. From data we have collected and corroborating third party reports, it seems China’s ravenous appetite for the 6 Plus will buoy Apple’s next reported earnings.
