I wrote earlier about an [iCloud Keychain App](https://bakingpixel.com/2020/05/there-should-be-an-icloud-keychain-app/). Then I saw a post about setting up keyboard shortcuts. This is in the similar situation as keychain. 

Managing shortcuts is simple enough for short replacements. However, if you want to expand larger chunks of text, then it becomes tricky managing these shortcuts. [Typinator](https://store.ergonis.com/products/typinator) is to Keyboard Shortcuts what 1Password is to iCloud Keychain.
