BirchTree reported on [the difference between Google Assistant and Siri](https://birchtree.me/blog/the-difference-between-google-assistant-and-siri/).

> The tech narrative is that Siri sucks and Google Assistant is the second coming. I have been using Siri for years, and have been going 100% in on Android over the last few weeks and have given Google Assistant a solid effort. My experience has been a little different than the popular narrative. 

I haven&#8217;t tried Google Assistant but Siri is so far good enough for my daily usage.
