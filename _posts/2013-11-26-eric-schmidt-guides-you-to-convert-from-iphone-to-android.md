This is pretty novel. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, has used his Google+ page to pen a step-by-step guide on how to move from iPhone to Android. It might sound gimmicky, as there are already plenty of guides on how to make the switch out there, but more importantly it will be interesting to see if that guide actually discourages people from making the switch, since it seems slightly complicated for an end-user to me.

> Here are the steps I recommend to make this switch. Like the people who moved from PCs to Macs and never switched back, you will switch from iPhone to Android and never switch back as everything will be in the cloud, backed up, and there are so many choices for you. 80% of the world, in the latest surveys, agrees on Android.
