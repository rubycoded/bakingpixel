FireEye reports on [a mobile botnet called MisoSMS that is stealing SMS data from Android phones](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/botnet-activities-research/2013/12/misosms.html).

> MisoSMS infects Android systems by deploying a class of malicious Android apps. The mobile malware masquerades as an Android settings app used for administrative tasks. When executed, it secretly steals the user’s personal SMS messages and emails them to a command-and-control (CnC) infrastructure hosted in China. FireEye Mobile Threat Prevention platform detects this class of malware as “Android.Spyware.MisoSMS.” 

Seems like the majority of infected devices are in Korea. Still, Android users should remain alert.
