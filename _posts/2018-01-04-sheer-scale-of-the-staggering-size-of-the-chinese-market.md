Tech in Asia reported that [Singapore&#8217;s oBike reaches 10m rides but lags far behind rivals](https://www.techinasia.com/singapores-obike-reaches-10m-rides-lags-rivals).

> OBike, a bike-sharing startup founded in Singapore, has just reached 10 million rides since it was founded in January 2017. However, the homegrown company is still lagging behind Ofo and Mobike, its far-larger rivals from China.
> 
> Ofo, backed by Alibaba, announced in December last year that it saw 32 million rides a day. Meanwhile, Mobike clocked 20 million daily rides as of April 2017 and has Tencent in its corner. 

A lot of people have a hard time grasping the staggering scale in China. The daily rides for Ofo and Mobike are several times that of what OBike manages in a year. Wrap your head around that.
