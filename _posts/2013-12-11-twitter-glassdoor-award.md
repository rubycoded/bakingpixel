The Next Web reports that [Twitter is the top tech company in the sixth Glassdoor Employees’ Choice Awards](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/12/11/glassdoor-twitter-best-tech-company-work-ends-facebooks-three-year-streak-number-one/), a list of the top 50 best places to work for in the coming year.

Facebook held the number one spot among tech companies for the past three years, but slipped to third place this year. Twitter took first place while LinkedIn came in second.

> For those who aren’t familiar with it, the Employees’ Choice Awards is based on the input of employees who choose to provide feedback on their job, work environment, and company, via an anonymous online company review survey. Glassdoor then uses a “proprietary algorithm” to determine an overall ranking “based on the quantity, quality and consistency of reviews.”
