Bloomberg reported on [Apple becoming first US Company to hit $1 trillion value](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-02/apple-becomes-first-u-s-company-to-hit-1-trillion-market-value).

> Apple Inc. became the first U.S.-based company with a market value of $1 trillion, four decades after it was co-founded by Steve Jobs in a Silicon Valley garage and later revolutionized the worlds of computing, music and mobile communications. 

Apple has came out ahead of Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft in the race to the trillion mark.

> Apple was worth about $350 billion when Jobs died, so Cook has led the creation of even more stock-market value than his former boss and mentor. Bloomberg News asked him about the $1 trillion target in a February interview.

> &#8220;I don’t really think about it,&#8221; he said, suggesting that if the company keeps making successful products, financial success will follow. &#8220;I still view Apple as a pretty small company, the way that we operate. I know it’s not numerically, but the way we function is very much like that.&#8221; 

Focus on the products and consumers will appreciate it, even if some consumers lack the capacity to.
